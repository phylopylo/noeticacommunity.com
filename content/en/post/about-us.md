# The Board of Editors
Noetica was founded by a collective of William & Mary students seeking to expand the availability of undergraduate publications with the aim of promoting the interdisciplinary study of the premodern world. The Board of Editors, comprised of a general body of elected members and executive officers, is tasked with devising Noetica's annual publication and promoting its mission to champion connections with the Premodern world. Each member actively contributes to their respective committees, assisting in the strategic planning of events, initiatives, and refining journal protocols.
