# Noetica's Second Volume
Welcome to the second volume of Noetica. Under the guidance of the Editor-in-Chief, this edition continues the journal's commitment to excellent scholarship, passionate innovation, and meaningful engagement. This volume spans diverse contexts and periods, offering interdisciplinary inquiries that delve into historical themes such as Byzantine Iconoclasm, the Black Death, and priestly philosophy in Early Modern Rome and Revolutionary France. It also explores contemporary issues like appropriation of the past, opposition to cultural norms, working-class struggles, and censorship.

In addition to scholarly articles, this edition showcases creative works from Noetica's Creative Competition themed around Divinity, highlighting exceptional contributions like Ian Wilson's illustration "Jesus in Gethsemane" and Gabriel Dakake's poem "Will to Power." These works, along with others, underscore the importance of creativity in understanding the human experience.

This edition is made possible by the dedication of the Board of Editors, the support of the William & Mary Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program, and the generosity of the Charles Center, the Office of Student Leadership Development, and various donors. Special thanks are extended to Dr. Elizabeth Harbron, Dr. Alexander Angelov, and Dr. Philip Daileader for their invaluable contributions.
