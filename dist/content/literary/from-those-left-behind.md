**From Those Left Behind**

(Previously published by Inkblots Literary Magazine)
Art thou too far in earth to see me now: A thunderstorm in empty, landless sky, Whose drums of bolt-hot anger bellow loud As streaks of clear reality pass by? 
I did not get the chance to say good-bye - My first regret; and this my second pain: That even those who claimed to watch thee die Knew not if I would e’er see thee again. But why this fear of mysteries unknown? Forget not, soul, the origin of life. 
For every drop of human anguish shown, Three bloodied nails draw gloried joy from strife. For those who, left on earth, must still endure, God lifts our trembling heads to this assure.

**The Image of One Now Gone**

Wert thou oft walking twixt the balmy shade Of two enormous trunks of oaken trees, 
Or bent in some odd corner o’er a book, 
Thy tongue between thy teeth, thy arms ’round knees? I cannot hold thy picture fast in mind. 
Your mem’ry like a shade itself slips far 
As my poor heart in vain doth, weeping, strive To hold thee fast exactly as thou art. 
Yet as from trees might spindly seedlings sprout, The echo of thine image mirrors true. 
I see thy works and all thy heart poured out In joy upon the ones who best thee knew. So when again we meet, some golden time, I know thy future and thy past will blend, And I will know thee in thy Self sublime As some new person. Thou wilt mend 
With thy whole self the gap I now perceive – And Image will at last to Being cleave.
