### Boethius' Ingenuity: De Consolatione Philosophiae's Influence on Medieval Philosophy and Latin 

Born in the late 5th century, Boethius was a Roman philosopher who was widely known for his translations of Greek philosophy. They were the only Aristotelian works that were available during Latin Christendom until he was rediscovered in the 12th century. In addition to his translations of classical Greek philosophy, Boethius wrote a lot of works on Christian theology (*Opuscula Sacra*) and mathematics (*De Arithmetica*). His most famous work, however, was a philosophical treatise that he entitled *De Philosophiae Consolatione* or 'On the Consolation of Philosophy.' He uses this work to lament his imprisonment by Theodoric the Great in 523 and to attempt to reconcile the thoughts of Plato and Aristotle with Christian theology by having a dialogue with *Philosophia*. This work is widely considered to be theological as well as philosophical by many scholars, though Christianity is not mentioned once. Many think that this is because Boethius believed that he could prove the reality of Christianity purely from the lens of natural philosophy and the classical Greek tradition. In this paper, I will argue that the reason why he decided to not use scriptural allusions, is because he was attempting to reach the elite who would've been well-versed in both Greek philosophy and Latin literature. That is, Boethius, in his ingenuity, used his knowledge of Greek and Roman tradition to not only draw his readers in with common allusions but to also reshape their interpretations of the allusions by indirectly pointing them towards Christ through his interpretation.  
For many of Boethius' contemporaries, achieving true happiness was a goal to be strived for day after day, even when it entailed trial and tribulation. It is with this goal in mind that Boethius begins to draw people into his argument and reshape their way of perceiving what happiness means. To do this, he begins with a brief allusion to Stoicism in Book II by stating that, though goods are beneficial to the obtainment of felicity, they are ultimately irrelevant to true happiness—as that depends on the possession of virtues that lie within our control.[^1] With this framework in place, he shifts gears towards a more Platonist and Aristotelianism approach towards happiness, while also weaving in some Christian motifs that would've shocked some of his contemporaries in Book III.[^2]  
Some of these classical Greek allusions to Plato and Aristotle can be found throughout 3.3 when he discusses the various false ways that humanity attempts to achieve true happiness. There are several allusions to classical Greek philosophy, and that's just a fraction of the amount used in the treatise as a whole. The first of these allusions reinforces the rather popular Aristotelian idea that the end goal of humanity is achieving true happiness (*omnis…pervenire*).[^3] He follows this declaration by stating that humanity has been drawing towards various paths that ultimately lead to a false sense of true happiness (*est enim…abducit*), and by listing out the many false paths to true happiness that have been undertaken by humanity.[^4]   
One way that stands out to our modern eyes is that some people attempt to seek happiness through power (*sunt…constituant)*.[^5] This line is important because it stops the elite—the most likely readers of this work—in their tracks as it forces them to reconsider their life choices by showing them the fragility and temporariness of the "happiness" that they currently hold.[^6] Boethius builds upon this critique and points his readers to Christ by defining true happiness as the union of self-sufficiency, power, glory, and joy.[^7] This state of unity between these various aspects of happiness is unattainable by mortals. Even if this unity were achieved, it would never be truly self-sufficient, as it is transitory and divisible due to the nature in which it was acquired.  
This idea of true happiness existing in a different dimension and thus unattainable by us echoes Plato's allegory of "The Cave," and is yet another allusion to the classical Greek tradition that would've been well known to his readers.[^8] Unlike Plato, however, he links the idea of true happiness to God by defining God as true happiness.[^9] He does this by first defining God as good and that nothing can be perceived as greater than God because His goodness is perfect. From there it follows that, because God's goodness is supreme, and because supreme goodness is true happiness, true happiness is God. Thus, in one smooth motion, Boethius seamlessly laid out the philosophical meaning of happiness with various allusions to Plato and Aristotle and the underlying similarity between two seemingly antithetical approaches to happiness by connecting them to faith in God.   
Switching gears, Boethius marches forward with his philosophical argument for God with a slight twist by emulating the language and ideas of Virgil and Ovid. To do this, he first utilizes Menippean satire to set the stage for what is to come. At first glance, this seems rather out of place for a philosophical treatise, but things start to fall in place if one were to take a closer look at Boethius' circumstances when the book was written. Due to his imprisonment, he views himself as inept and ultimately constrained by the work he is about to undertake.[^10] Thus, by using Menippean satire, he utilizes the genre to his full advantage by allowing himself to wallow in sorrow while forcing *Philosophia* to console him and return him to his true self.   
He doesn't stop there, however, as even the imagery of *Philosophia* greatly echoes the choice of genre, as she is seen in tattered robes when Boethius first encounters her.[^11] This image of *Philosophia* encapsulates the struggle of philosophy against modern philosophers and the need for a champion to "save" philosophy from dying. Interestingly enough, this image echoes that of the Cynics, who Boethius did not sympathize with, and serves as the starting point of the transformation for the two. This is because, after *Philosophia* uses the negative instruction of Cynicism to drag Boethius out of self-forgetfulness, she becomes more and more Platonist as he begins to recognize the divine order of the world. Throughout this process, Boethius uses the genre to his advantage by showing that even though *Philosophia* is his guide to his "true home," she herself, along with her argument, is weak.[^12] Unsurprisingly, this leads to some frustration between her and Boethius, and it reveals that the ultimate gift of *Philosophia* is death and that *Philosophia* cannot provide all of the answers to his questions. From this simple framework, Boethius has shown that the ultimate answer to all of humanity's questions lies not in philosophical theory but in God.  
With his core argument now set up, Boethius jumps right into the thick of things by echoing the language of Virgil's *Aeneid*. One such example can be seen in Chapter 2 of Book I when *Philosophia* tries to wipe away the cloud of mortal concerns that was covering Boethius' eyes (*paulisper lumina eius mortalium rerum nube caligantia tergamus*).[^13] This brief phrase is a clear call back to *Aeneid* 2.206-207 where Venus is wiping away the cloud that is preventing Aeneas from the seeing the destructive nature of the gods (*aspice—namque omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti mortalis hebetat visus tibi et umida circum caligat, nubem eripiam*).[^14] These similarities do not stop there, however, as both Virgil and Boethius use *terror* and *dolor* to describe Aeneas and himself, respectively. Continuing this trend they also both use the verb *obstipescere* to describe their characters' current states even though they arrive at these states due to rather different situations (Aeneas is worrying about his family during a time of war while Boethius is lamenting his imprisonment). Even the appearances of Venus and *Philosophia* before Aeneas and Boethius also mirror each other, as they are not only acknowledged immediately as divine beings but also approach them in rather similar ways (Venus grabs Aeneas' hand to drag him back to reality while *Philosophia* places a hand on Boethius' chest). Similarly, their admonishment and promise of reprieve echo each other as they are both shocked at how Aeneas and Boethius have lost all sense of reason while also promising to remove the clouds from their eyes so that they can see the true reality of their situation.  
This uncovering of the eyes, however, leads to two contrasting conclusions about their reality. For Aeneas, this leads to an understanding of *divum inclementia* (harshness of the gods) in *Aeneid* 2.602 and thus an acceptance of the role that it plays in the lives of mortals.[^15] For Boethius, however, this uncovering will lead to a wiping away of his misconstrued understanding of divine will (e.g. God, the *summum bonum*, directs all things to that good) and thus a renewal in his faith. From here, Boethius continues to mold this allusion into his argument by showcasing how their respective heroic journeys from this point on lead to different results. He does this by first recognizing that even though Aeneas is ultimately able to achieve his end goal of founding a city, he does this against what has been will by the gods.[^16] He then contrasts this by showing that even though he has been exiled, it is by his own doing not by God's, and that the only way to remove himself from exile is to gain in his knowledge of the *summum bonum*. That is, the only way for anxiety to be truly taken is not by resignation to one's fate, but instead to give it all to the providence of God's benevolence. Thus, through this seemingly innocent image that would've appealed to many of his readers throughout history, Boethius can once again show his readers what it means to trust in God.  
Moving on from Virgil, Boethius now switches gears one more time to reinterpreting the images of love utilized by Ovid. One of the first distinctions that Boethius makes between divine love and Ovidian is that instead of being used for divine philandering and showcasing how the gods are oft too human, Boethian love shows the divine ordering of God.[^17] One of the ways he does this is by reminiscing the story of Phaethon in Book 2 of Ovid's *Metamorphoses*.[^18] In this story, we see a father who gives into his son's wishes, and in doing so casts destruction on the world due to Phaethon losing the reins (*ra remisit*, 2.200) and allowing the horses to go both unchecked (*nulloque inhibente*, 2.202) and unguided  (*sine lege ruunt*, 2.204). This is the image that would've been in the mind of Boethius' readers as they came across *sedet. . . conditor altus / rerumque regens flectit habenas* (Here the Founder sits on high, and the ruler pulls at the reins of things).  
With this framework now in place, Boethius begins to contrast these two god-like deities by establishing that while the Ovidian tale describes Sol as not creator-deity, but one who is merely the ruler of all that pertains to meteorology, God is both the origin and creator of all things and rules over all things out of his *amor* for us.[^19] Continuing with this train of thought, Boethius also contrasts the parental role that each of the deities plays in their children's lives. For Sol, this parental role is not only questioned but it is ultimately usurped as he relinquishes his power to his untrained son. God, on the other hand, never relinquishes his control to others, and his guidance forever remains supreme as his parental role is never challenged or usurped. It is this love which brings harmony to all. It is this love that Boethius reveals to not only be the creator of the universe, but also that binds humanity to the divine.[^20] Thus, with yet another simple echoing of Roman literature, Boethius can highlight the seemingly irreconcilable themes of *amor* found in Ovid and in Christianity by tying *lex* and *amor* together in the Platonic *erôs*, a deity who is both God and Love.   
So, what does all of this have to say about Boethius and *De Consolatione Philosophiae*? If there is one thing that is certain, it is the fact that he really did believe in his ability to argue for Christianity from purely a philosophical lens. This, however, did not mean that he believed philosophy to be the answer to all theological questions, as even he conceded that the only way to answer all of humanity's questions is through faith in God. Even with all of these things laid out, however, Boethius still manages to include some implicit Scriptural allusions, as he not only portrays himself in the image of Job but also *Philosophia* as a representation of *Sapientia* throughout the opening pages of the treatise.[^21]  
What makes this work so special, however, is not its simplicity and accessibility, but the reach that it had on Latin Christendom and Medieval Philosophy, as his words were quoted for several centuries after his death in a variety of works by other well-known authors such as Dante, Milton, and Chaucer. The work was even translated into Old, Middle, and Early Modern English, Old French, Old High German, and multiple times into Italian throughout the centuries by nobles, thus proving both its longevity and its popularity amongst the elite. Traces of the work can still be found in Tolkien, and it is even referenced by the likes of C.S. Lewis.   
From this rather cursory overview of the many allusions that Boethius uses in his treatise, we can begin to get an idea of what the spiritual and political atmosphere looked like during the early Medieval Era. We see a world that was captivated by the philosophy and ideals of the Greco-Roman world but was still struggling to reconcile them with the teachings of Christianity. And it is through this captivation that Boethius can begin to formulate a formal connection between the two contradicting worlds as someone who also entangled himself within the web of Greco-Roman philosophy. Boethius reached various peoples across time and space by giving them a way into the world of Christianity that had never been offered to them outside the likes of Augustine. Boethius didn't believe philosophy had all of the answers regarding Christianity, but he thought it to be the most efficient way to convince his readers of God if they didn't have faith.
