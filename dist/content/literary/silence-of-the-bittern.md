The echoes of the waterfall resound along the cavern And rebound in your ears. 
The faint smudges of chocolate around your lips tempts you To break your fast 
Again. 
Step out of your cave, and the light is overwhelming - Towing you under, 
Staggering you 
Again. 
You crawl back, to try tomorrow. 
And tomorrow 
Again. 
It finally occurs to you to close your eyes - 
Small steps, with a blindfold of flesh, 
And the light is cool and beautiful, 
When you don’t look at it. 
Again. 
Without the waterfall roaring in your ears, 
The silence is sublime. 
The bittern takes flight silently, 
But its wings thump a heavy rhythm 
That makes your veins pulse and follow: Again, again, again. 
Out of Plato’s cave, 
You can mark your way with a compass And trace your path along the leaves, And at last open your eyes. 
But your blood is hot 
With the silence of the bittern, 
Following the wanderlust of the birds Far into the eternal sky 
Again.
