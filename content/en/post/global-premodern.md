# What does the "Global Premodern" mean to Noetica?

Noetica presents itself as a "Journal of Global Premodern Studies," which prompts the question: what does "Premodern" truly mean? If you were to inquire with a historian, you'd receive varied responses based on their region and perspective. European historians often define the Premodern era as anything prior to 1500, whereas scholars of American history often place the cutoff at the turn of the twentieth century. However, Noetica takes a different approach, grounding the concept of "Premodern" in historical reality while avoiding entanglement in historiographical disputes, adopting instead a more philosophical method for defining this term. For us, "Premodern" describes the periods of the past that modern scholarship increasingly diminishes and sidelines. Noetica's mission is to bridge the intellectual gap that separates us from the distant past, enabling a more profound study of those eras and their influence on our contemporary world. In essence, "Premodern" denotes the connection between these remote mindsets and conceptualizations, which may appear foreign but still exert influence on modern society.
