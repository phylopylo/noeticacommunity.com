We keep the silent watch of living things, 
Who stand the solemn sentinels at either end 
Of life. We keep a vast, eternal ring 
Around the poor, terrestrial beings who each send 
Their prayers and their hopes toward the sky, 
Who fling their foolish, weary burdens far from them 
In desp’rate bid that one might catch our eye. 
We keep the sympathetic watch of living things.
Bukkido 
When water and fire could not Subdue you, 
You rose from the ground Spitting out dirt 
And stood there simply, Meek and bold – 
“One more time”, 
As backalley fistfights 
Are wont to go. 
But still you get up 
And up 
And up 
And up 
Until they don’t know 
What to do 
In the face of such 
Humble, near-apologetic Defiance 
Except turn about, 
Trace their footsteps back And leave you, 
Standing.
