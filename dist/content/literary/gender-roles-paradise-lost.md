What is masculinity and femininity? Are there any inherent differences between the two and, if so, do they naturally lend themselves to a hierarchy between male and female? If there aren’t any differences, then what may lead someone to think that there are? For John Milton these are some of the many questions that he attempts to tackle in his epic, *Paradise Lost*. In this work, Milton argues that humanity’s relationship with nature is a major influence, if not the sole influence, on how Satan and Eve approach gender roles in Eden. Throughout the selections that we read in class, particularly in Books IV and IX, Milton argues that even though both Satan and Eve view Eve as the one being more closely connected to nature, they each take away very different ideas of what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman. For Satan being closely connected with nature leads to a natural submissiveness and a need to be subjugated by man, whereas for Eve, it leads to a false sense of parity between her and Adam and ends up being the root cause of the Fall.  
From the beginning of the poem, Satan’s observations of Adam and Eve lead him to view Eve as subordinate. In lines 304-308 of Book IV, Satan describes Eve as “a veil down to the slender waist / Her unadorned golden tresses wore / Disheveled, but in wanton ringlets waved / as the vine curls her tendrils, which implied / Subjection…” In these few lines we see Satan’s very first impression of Eve and what is most striking is that he describes her hair as “wanton.” This word, as we see later in lines 627-629 is how Adam describes Eden to Eve as he says “…with branches overgrown, / That mock our scant manuring, and require / More hands than our to lop their wanton growth.” By using the same word to describe both Eve and Eden, Milton is making it very clear to us that Eve is very closely related to nature even if the descriptions come from two distinct sources.  
Furthermore, in those very same lines Satan describes Eve’s physical appearance as one that “implies subjection” which was established earlier on in lines 295-299 where he says “Whence true authority in men; though both / Not equal, as their sex not equal it seemed; / For contemplation he and valor formed, / For softness she and sweet attractive grace, / He for God only, she for God in him.” Satan believes that Eve’s relationship with nature makes her subordinate not only in the work of the garden but even in her relationship with God.  For Satan, Eve being so closely related to nature is what gives Adam power over her, and by extension man over woman. It is her relationship with nature and nature’s relationship to man that defines these “traits” of hers.   
Satan describes Adam as made for both contemplation and valor, whereas Eve was made for softness and sweet attractive grace. Although Satan’s perspective is colored by his rebellion against God, some level of hierarchy seems to be natural in God’s creation of Adam and Eve. For example, in lines 257-58 and 267-271 of Book VIII, Adam says to Raphael that he “Straight toward heav’n my wondering eyes I turned, / And gazed a while the ample sky, till raised” and that “Myself then I perused, and limb by limb / Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran / With supple joints, as lively vigor led / But who I was, or where, or from what cause, / Knew not.” These lines drive home the point that Adam was, from the moment he was born, contemplating the things around him. And it is because of this unique relationship with nature, that he is considered better than Eve and more fit for “masculine” tasks. According to Milton, it is not just biological and physiological differences that lead to these differences but also mental and psychological differences that lead to this supposed hierarchy between men and women.  
Adam’s contemplative relationship with nature sets him apart from Eve. Some of these examples can be found in lines 449-452 and lines 460-466 of Book IV where she says “That day I oft remember, when from sleep / I first awaked, and found myself reposed / Under a shade on flowers, much wond’ring where  And what I was, whence thither brought, and how” and “As I bent down to look, just opposite, A shape within the wat’ry gleam appeared / Bending to look on me, /… / there I had fixed / Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire.” It’s clear that Eve experienced her creation in a very different manner compared to Adam. Here, Eve is seen as a lost, helpless creature who needs to be guided and directed to do what is required of her.   
These traits that Satan points out are further exemplified in lines 477-480 of Book IV where Eve says, “Till I espied thee / … / me thought less far, / Less winning soft, less amiably mild, / Than that smooth wat’ry image.” It seems that Eve views her relationship with nature, and by extension herself, to be better and purer than what God has planned for her. We see her initially reject Adam after being led to him by God and it is only through some persuasion from Adam that she resigns herself to be in a relationship with him. It also shows how Eve is dependent on Adam to have a relationship with God as it is through him and not herself that she is able to fulfill what God has set out before her. It is partially because of this indirect relationship to God through Adam that she has a different understanding of the dominion mandate, is perceived by Satan to be more easily tempted, and requires some help to understand the magnitude of the punishment that came about from the Fall.  
But what do these lines have to say about Eve and her own perceptions of her relationship with Adam?  As we have seen her relationship with Adam is not something that she desired; she would rather spend time with herself and nature. These sentiments are further exemplified in both her discussions on labor with Adam and her temptation in Book IX. For example, in lines 220-225 she says “For while so near each thus all day / Our task we choose, what wonder if so near / Looks intervene and smiles / … / which intermits / Our day’s work brought to little / … / and th’ hour of supper comes unearned.” From these lines we see not only a wish to be away from Adam but also a different interpretation of what it means to labor. She sees labor not only as something that needs to be done but also as something that rewards her. In other words, Eve believes that there is a reciprocal relationship between humanity and nature.  
How does this analysis help us to understand Eve’s perception of gender roles? One interpretation of her beliefs is that because she believes there to be a reciprocal relationship between humanity and nature, she also believes that a reciprocal relationship should also exist between man and woman. In other words, she believes in parity between male and female. This belief is tested by Satan in lines 687-691 where he says “… Look on me, / Me who have touched and tasted, yet both live, / And life more perfect have attained than fate / Meant me, by vent’ring higher than my lot. / Shall that be shut to man.” From these lines we see Satan goad Eve into thinking about her relationship with Adam and contemplate the gender roles they currently inhabit. And though it takes some further pushing to get Eve to finally eat from the Tree of Knowledge, she eventually does so as she believes it to be the only way for her to achieve parity with Adam. However, the very act that Eve takes to establish the parity she longs for in her relationship with Adam ultimately leads to the establishment of concrete gender roles.  
Before we get to the punishment of humanity, however, let’s first discuss the beginnings of the Fall and what Eve felt when she ate of the fruit. In lines 817-825 of Book IX Eve says “… shall I to him make known as yet my change / … / or rather not, / … / so to add what wants / in female sex, the more to draw his love, / And render me more equal, and perhaps, / … / A thing not undesirable, sometime / Superior; for inferior who is free?” From these lines we see Eve, for the first time, explicitly questioning both her own role in Eden and her relationship with Adam. She questions whether she truly loves Adam and if this newfound parity is something to be cherished. We see her question what it means to subordinate to Adam and if this newfound freedom is what she envisioned it to be. Eve is asking the very same questions that we have been asking ourselves throughout the history of mankind and like us is struggling to reconcile the fact that is “natural” hierarchy even exists.  
How does all of this relate back to nature though? Well, as stated earlier, this all started because of Eve’s perception that there was a lack of parity in her relationship with Adam which resulted from a lack of reciprocity between the two of them. But there’s so much more to this than just that. Eve can not only be read as being closely related to nature, but she can also be read as nature personified. This personification is especially clear when we read the eating of the fruit in tandem with the punishment of Eve. When we observe Eve eating of the fruit in lines 781-783 of Book IX, we also observe how “Earth felt the wound, and nature from her seat / Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe, / That all was lost.” This similar image is also seen in lines 1000-1004 when Adam eats of the fruit, where we again observe how “Earth trembled from her entrails, as again / In pangs, and nature gave a second groan; / Sky loured, and muttering thunder, some sad drops / Wept at completing of the mortal sin original.” From these two parallel verses, we see a clear image of nature suffering because of the Fall and how it undergoes a change just as Adam and Eve do when they get punished.  
So how does any of this relate to Eve being a personification of nature? Well, now that we’ve established how nature is groaning and suffering due to the Fall, let’s look at how Eve fares. When God finds out about their transgression against him, He sends the Son to judge them and during this judgment all three parties are punished. For Eve, as we see in lines 193-196 of Book X, her punishment is that “Thy sorrow … will greatly multiply / By thy conception; children thou shalt bring / In sorrow forth, and to thy husband’s will / Thine shall submit, he over thee shall rule.” Just as how the Earth is punished to sorrow from not only the growth of thorns and thistles but also for the sake of man, Eve is punished to suffering and groaning in childbirth for the sake of man. Eve has now become fully one with nature both in her relationship with Adam and in her suffering.  
So, what does all this mean when we take a step back to look at the bigger picture and the overall message of *Paradise Lost*? Well, if there is one thing that we take away from all of this, it is that not only is nature crucial to the portrayal of gender roles in epic but also through what lens we are perceiving nature. Throughout all of this we saw how both Satan and Eve viewed Eve, who eventually becomes identical to nature, as having similar characteristics to nature. But due to their different perceptions of what nature is due to their different experiences with God, we see drastic differences in how they each view gender roles not only in Eden but in society as well. And if there’s anything to take away from that discussion, it is that John Milton views gender parity as the reason for the Fall and as such wishes to not only reinforce the “natural hierarchy” created by the Fall but to also put the blame of the Fall solely on the shoulders of Eve.
