I am quiet here alone. By the sink standing. I let the tap run over my finger, waiting for it to go warm, and soon it runs warm. Give me the words. I slide a pan underneath the tap, and scrub it, and then afterwards another pan slide and scrub. Tell me. That somebody looked at me strange and it blew me off the face of the earth. That here, by this sink, washing these pans, do I feel myself returning, to this place, to the nothing that I am, into the waking hurting. Tell.

Henry sits in the Quiet Room. His eyes and mind wonky circles and he nothing has now. Tap tap tap his fingers. Tap tap tap against the bottom of his chair. Thoughts like fish nibbling the coral of Henry. One hundred days since the wires of his brain hanging loose out of his face blood splat splat splatting the pavegrey red. Now he's Afternoon bedtime Henry. Bones Henry. I turn the hot water off and balance the pans on the drying rack, looking out the window towards another place. 

Henry. Uncle Henry. Mother's brother. Our father. I remember you. Never coming back. And I cannot follow. One thousand angels beeping, whirring, scanning, controlling, alerting, monitoring, all for to keep the pulse the trellis of your silence. Henry lives behind the clouds. Henry is the space between, and sometimes Mother says she sees a shape appear in the sky of Henry, grey against grey, a white face crying black rain. Horror drifts through the open window of Henry. No brain could cohere. 

Let me crawl in through your window Henry. Me and you our blood connects. Across this synapse, this separation. Whisper across it the words to Lord graciously release us. I am so sad, so lonely here. Let me in. One hundred days since they found you bleeding on the road. La ree. Eeezy beezy. The crash is inside me now. The warm water against my skin now. Me she loves now. Let me tell you. Me she loves. My voice she wanted to hear as she. Your head cracked on the tarmac, all the words spilling out. Panels of light drifting like jellyfish across me. These are deep waters bluedrifting through. Wave unto wave your body rocking. Graciously hear us.

It began started when I walking was. In the red light of a traffic waiting on the pavement. Across the road cars speed and beep a stampeding polluting riverherd. And in me sudden came this thought: Into this road I will walk. By this stampede I will be cut down. To these cars will I carry my crash. And to me sudden visions of an angel on the road gathering up the broken parts of me in its wings, faintly glowing in the moonstreets.

The next five nights I no sleep had. Purple thoughts and thoughts glowing darkly, I was deep in the fish tank. On the first night I lay and thought of. On the second I read and read of. On the third I unfolded and folded every memory of. The fourth I a high priest was ordained, order of. On the fifth my angel near me came, gathering, gathering. Then: sleep like a machine unplugged. Five medications now daily. Oh I see your hand tremble. Mine too. Filing thoughts the five fingers are. And you, you, Say that you never. 

But still: scrubbing these pans by the window will be done on earth. I turn the tap off and go outside. Cigarette no. Another coffee yes. Henry had an accident. OK. This is a strange distance from grief. The fact is Henry – Henry – the fact is you were smoothed out against the road. Which does not change the fact that I am here thinking thoughts. I could be so happy. The sun disappears. I go back inside to watch the cars, each one a brief vanishing. Every thought its own brief dream. He had his eyes and ears and hands removed, and the holes of his body filled in, and lies waiting, plugged in to beautiful machines and surrounded by beautiful blue faces, rising into a heaven of brilliant billboards.

After much sliding and scrubbing I go upstairs to stand at my window, waiting for the first drops of darkness, when another night run begins. I draw my curtains and breath a while. I read. I have been awake too long now. There is a window opening in me, letting in the badbads. Where my sad self stands is so cold. I drinks hot tea. I sits and knits. I writes but bleeds dry. I thinks of Henry. And then I thinks this: I must remove those bits of food from the sink. Too big to drain. Will get annoyed again. And the bins Tuesday is it? Spending too much. Shave tomorrow. Nails. Write to. She asked. Remember. And get her to send. Because not long til. Gathering gathering. Building a nest of night thoughts for sleeping in. Sleep, my love, in my nest of thoughts, singing your song of Yes to life.

*Kiss of our agony Thou gatherest,*  
*O Hand of Fire*  
*gatherest—*

The doctor says Henry is improving but too slow. The doctor says that his daughter has blocked his number, won't speak to him. The doctor doubled his dose. The doctor is so sorry. Doctor Doing Her Best. Doctor Keeping Henry Alive, who art in hell.

I eat tomatoes and I eets beets. I know what he wants because. There is also nothing in my heart. Carry him home.

Henry had a thousand stories. You should have heard Henry's story about finding those bones, that night before Christmas. Every morning now Henry stands at his window and looks out at the wind turbines. If Henry had wings he would fly right through them, and then back through them, and then back through them, and then back through them, like a swinging pendulum, and the blades would flash right through him, and right through him, and right through him, like a guillotine, and Henry would be scattered across the black Earth like one thousand seeds. 

Light streams through the dirty glass, wave after wave of brightness on the land. What are you doing in the soul of the abandoned, Henry, visible only to those who love you? What do you see outside the window? A white wooden cross? Five wind turbines? One thousand invisible stars.

Pray for Henry tonight: that every last drop of life leaves him, alone. Amen.

The orange door swings open on its hinges. The day passing darkly, and you find me on the tracks, gathering, where I have no secrets, only that soon flowers from my body will grow.

Nothing has changed. When you walk in silence blows through the door. I can't explain the state that I'm in. It is easier if you see me like this: briefly before. I looks around. Tea? Yes. Two teas with automatic hand, one for me and one for you. 

Suddenly the dishwasher dies. Do you remember how I took out each piece of cutlery, piece by piece, and carried it home? How neat the designations into metal shapes; rectangle, big and little spoonses, sharp nyves for purposes unclear and extreme, nyves for purposes ordinary and culinary, focks? How you liked the metal of it, the sound of the metal crashing against metal, the rows of all the metal lined in same direction like towards a magnet?

And then how you rushed over to help? Never you knew the flash of a man falling in my brain, beckoning the bads. Honey there's a beautiful row of big plates for you, m'lady, still warm from washing. And once you're done with the big plates we can do the small plates together, the one I like with the chickens on, and the one I eat kiwis on, and the one that is perfect for two slices of nices. We finish the bottom row in quiet: the cutlery, the big plates, the small plates. Please. Flash of a man falling.

And then the top row: glasses, mugs, metal I was too lazy to. You don't need directing where to and you don't need help with because you know exactly the places. The plastic and the metal spatula together. My Hebrew alphabet mug. Shalom, mug, boker tov. Le'hitra'ot. I think you must have been washed one hundred times. And I think you likes it although you say you are happier in the cupboard with your friends. Given to me by. But still, property of me. You know every detail of this kitchen visible and invisible, as if your brain were a dolls house, and one of its rooms were this room, perfectly miniaturized, draws and the contents of draws, the plates up there, the pans down here and the trays slid into this corner. You carry my kitchen with you. You carry it in your brain.

We talk and then some more. and then silence, then we talks some more. You sit and I sit and we talk, at the morning end of night. We have our teas – we could be happy. 

And I wonder what a kind of a night you had. Didst thou sleep well? Did you turn the light off and slide? Or did you rise into the nocturne, naked, your eyes flowers, and your skin petals pressed between the pages of your worst hours? 

Well a knock comes then, and a man. Let me. No I did not. No I have not seen. Yes if I anything happens. Found on the road. Gosh how awful. Good day Mr Pensbury Sir.

Sitting sideways to the light you are. Like an evening branch. Flash of a man falling. Through the branches. I am waiting for you to leave, and you do leave. Two dirty mugs the only evidence. Suddenly all my sadness becomes desire, and I loads them, falling.
