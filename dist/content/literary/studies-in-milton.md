In Milton’s *Paradise Lost*, “glory” and “fall” represent opposite ends of a normative hierarchy. How these words are used either conforms to this hierarchy or subverts it. The subversive uses support the concept of the Fortunate Fall that remains central to Milton’s theological message. Regardless of whether the uses conform or subvert, however, both demonstrate that the underlying result is not about where one is in the hierarchy, but about free will.   
Milton’s hierarchy of “glory” and “fall” extends beyond the individual words. They represent a larger subset of ideas and words that describe the opposite ends of the hierarchy and how one moves in relation to them. The word “glory” stands for the top of the hierarchy. Milton refers to God, his actions, and his character as having glory and being glorious. Though Milton draws a hierarchical distinction between the Son and the Father, glory also refers to the Son as the “image of \[the Father’s\] glory” (3.63). Milton establishes the power of the Son by describing them both with glory. The Father and the Son set the bar for glory. The height of glory is the essence of their character. Raphael teaches Adam the importance of tending towards God like a “green stalk” growing towards the sun (5.469-505). *Paradise Lost* is about tending upward toward God and toward glory. The subset of glory encompasses words like Heaven, ascend, and light. Referring to something with these terms brings it closer to the attributes of God.  
The word “fall” is the inverse of glory. Instead of God, fall refers to Satan, Hell, and descent. Since the hierarchy of Paradise Lost bases itself on God, to fall is to take oneself away from God and from his glory willingly. When Satan and his angels fall, they throw themselves off a cliff “headlong” (6.864). They choose Hell rather than submit to God’s authority. God leaves Adam and Eve “free to fall” as well (3.99). They are escorted out of Paradise because of their fall. Fall and glory stand as opposed forces. Moving towards one means to move away from the other.      
The levels of glory and fall naturally create a spatial hierarchy. All the language of glory relates to moving up. The language of fall relates to moving down. Perceptions of Heaven and Hell test this spatial awareness that Milton relies on. Heaven is in the sky while Hell is down in the earth. The framework of physical space allows for physical descriptions of high and low to reveal the spiritual state of characters. God created Adam and Eve to stand “erect and tall, / Godlike erect” (4.288-9). They tend towards Heaven by standing up straight. When Adam and Eve begin to lower themselves closer to the earth, however, the reader knows they are in error spiritually. Eve says she “bent down to look” at her reflection in the water (4.460). After the fall, Adam lies down “on the ground / Outstretched” to bewail his condition (10.850-1). Unfortunately, in doing so, he turns even further from God. The spatial plane indicates the spiritual plane.  
The separation of glory and fall as opposing divisions introduces a principle that holds throughout the work. Trying to attain glory for oneself results in a fall. Satan exemplifies this theme as he rises against the Father “With envy against the Son” (5.662). Satan has many speeches and points to rationalize his rebellion, but in the end, he admits that “pride and worse ambition threw \[him\] down” out of Heaven (4.40). Satan does not try to rise in the hierarchy as a natural tending upwards, but he tries to pull himself up contrary to the will of God. Eve’s fall also revolves around trying to rise which results in a disastrous fall. Satan tempts Eve through her looks as a “celestial beauty” and “universally adored” (9.540, 542). None of these things tempt Eve, however, but she is moved by her desire to be “more equal” to Adam (9.823). Seeking glory for oneself undermines the definition of glory, which flows from God’s own character. Having glory without God is impossible. Attempting to have glory without God can only exile one from the source of glory.  
Milton sets up an elaborate hierarchy. He establishes a dichotomy of words, concepts, and spatial references that encompasses all the characters and actions of *Paradise Lost*. Milton also subverts this whole system throughout the work. Book X contains several clear subversions of the glory and fall hierarchy as Satan becomes associated with glory and another of Adam and Eve’s falls brings them closer to God.  
 Book X includes three instances of Satan connected with the word glory. Satan, the chief fallen angel, should never be associated with glory, but three times in Book X, these opposing poles coincide. The first time, Satan uses glory to refer to himself. Speaking to personified Sin, Satan says, “I glory in the name / ‘Antagonist of Heav’n’s Almighty King’” (10.386-7). The word glory does not reflect God but instead gives praise and worship to Satan and his self-made title. Ironically, Satan must invoke God if he wants to have any glory at all; the only significance he has is in opposing God. Satan worships his refusal to align with God on anything. He fulfills his speech, “Evil, be thou my good” made at the very beginning of his journey to Paradise (4.110). He thinks he has accomplished his goal and brought glory to himself apart from God. Book X follows Satan as he confidently returns to Hell. He assures himself of victory, after the ruin of God’s good creation in Book IX. The second time glory is subverted, Satan uses it to refer to the conquest of Sin and Death. He calls their journey towards Paradise a “glorious march,” one that tends upwards from Hell to Earth (10.474). Sin and Death confirm Satan’s victory over him. They are the first wave of a victory procession to the corrupted earth. Now, Hell and Earth are connected by the “broad way” that will allow the fallen angels freedom to travel between worlds (10.473). Through their fall, mankind is connected to Hell rather than Heaven. In the third subversive instance, the narrator refers to Satan as the “glorious chief” of Hell (10.537). The narrator associates Satan with rule, power, and authority over others. This characterization mirrors his “transcendent glory” at the Stygian Council (2.427). The subversion legitimizes his authority over the other fallen angels. In Satan’s eyes, he has triumphed. He successfully made Adam and Eve fall, ruining their standing with God. By relating Satan with glory, Milton turns the hierarchy on its head. Satan seems to be at the top.  
Adam and Eve also disrupt the regular system of glory and fall in Book 10\. Book X ends with Adam and Eve reconciling both with themselves and with God. It ends with them praying for forgiveness on the ground in submission. Spatially, it is the worst position a man could be in. Adam and Eve “prostrate fall” (10.1099). Everything about the word fall and the spatial connotations of being on the ground point to a negative spiritual result. However, by praying confessing, and repenting with “sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek” they grow closer to God. They find peace. Falling intentionally and purposefully draws them closer to God.  
By subverting the poles of glory and fall, Milton reveals the theme of the Fortunate Fall. Book X is the lowest point in *Paradise Lost*. The Son delivers curses to all involved. Satan parades back to Hell in triumph, though with some adverse side effects. Adam and Eve contemplate suicide, hate each other, and doom their children to a life of sin. Nevertheless, Adam and Eve “find grace” (3.131). God delivers them this grace and salvation even before they fall. In the fall, their obedience and worship take on a new purpose; it is no longer rote or taken for granted. ‘The Fortunate Fall’ in the Catholic mass refers to Adam and Eve’s fall because it necessitates the coming of Christ. In Milton, the incarnation is a fortunate fall of its own. God lays all these events out in Book III. The Son is always associated with glory. In Milton’s hierarchy, he is second only to the Father. The Son volunteers to fall so that mankind can be raised up towards God.  
... I for his sake will leave  
Thy bosom and this *glory* next to Thee  
Freely put off and for him lastly die  
(3.238-240, emphasis added)   
The Son’s willing descent to Earth is the true Fortunate Fall, made certain before Adam and Eve have even been introduced. The Son will “stoop / Inglorious” for a time, but by doing so, will make the Father even more glorious (3.252-3). Satan will be defeated, and Man will be reunited with God, continuing to tend upwards. The essence of glory falls so that mankind may rise.   
*Paradise Lost* sets up and subverts the poles of glory and fall. The hierarchical framework provides context for the spiritual state of the character. In the end, however, the hierarchy fails to adequately explain the rises and falls of the characters. Instead, the intentions of the characters determine their progressions. Satan seeks his own glory and power by taking it from God. His intentions are self-glorifying. As a result, he falls. Eve seeks her own advancement by eating the fruit, and she falls as well. Adam chooses Eve over God and falls. By shifting their intentions back to God, Adam and Eve are restored by falling into repentance and giving praise to God. Satan never repents or lowers himself and is not restored. The Son perfectly exemplifies the glory of lowering oneself. By sacrificing his position, dignity, and glory, the Son brings glory to God and himself. The intention to fall in humility, because mankind is created “free to fall,” brings one closer to glory (3.99). Milton’s concept of free will and choice governs the rise and fall of the characters even if the hierarchy frames the perspective.
