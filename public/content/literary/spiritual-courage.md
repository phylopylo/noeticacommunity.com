Existentialism concerns the principles of being. What does it mean to be? How are we to be? There are different states of being that define the human. Do we exist in joy, fear, melancholy, etc.? Emotional realities are not merely passing states of being, but the structures which come to define our everyday life. I will argue that courage is the most necessary mode of being for developing a self. Faith is required for any real knowledge of being, and to approach God’s throne with faith requires courage. Lev Shestov (1866–1938), a Russian Jewish philosopher known for his critique of rationalism, argues that faith is opposed to knowledge. Nikolai Berdyaev (1874–1948), a Russian theologian who focused on the intersection of freedom and creativity within Christianity, says that faith creates authentic personality. Human authenticity is founded upon the virtue of spiritual courage, which overcomes all of material reality. This courage drags the individual beyond good and evil to a realm where only God’s voice has significance, and enables them to find purpose in the recognition of their lack of knowledge. 

In *Great Expectations,* Charles Dickens’ protagonist describes Miss Havisham: "The admission of the fact that she had been in the same state of mind for many years had a strange effect on me. She looked at me with an expression of such melancholy and despair that I was almost afraid to speak to her." Emotional states are not merely flashes of feeling that are contained to one’s soul. Over time, they create the person, and define them ontologically. Every human is created by the sum of their experiences, and the way they react to these experiences through their responding emotional reality. As far as philosophy goes, it is the human’s job to try and regulate their spiritual state in the face of every life experience for the sake of becoming a self. I will argue that God is the great definer of personality, and to find one’s self has more to do with a blind faith than any psychological hierarchies that are observable in nature. Following faith comes courage—to approach God’s throne and walk away marks an individual with the observable characteristic of courage, as you cannot be exalted to Heaven without being humbled by Hell. 

Let us first understand the necessity of faith within the metaphysical hierarchy of needs. There are two roads to walk according to Shestov, that of freedom and necessity. With God you are free, as God is free; and with the world you are enslaved. In *Notes From the Underground,* Dostoevky’s ‘Underground Man’ reflects on the difference between freedom and necessity: “But, good Lord, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if I have my reasons for disliking them, including the one about two and two making four\! Of course, I won't be able to breach this wall with my head if I'm not strong enough. But I don't have to accept a stone wall just because it's there and I don't have the strength to breach it. As if such a wall could really leave me resigned and bring me peace of mind because it's the same as twice two makes four\! How stupid can one get? Isn't it much better to recognize the stone walls and the impossibilities for what they are and refuse to accept them if surrendering makes one too sick?”1 This quote summarizes the central theme of Shestov’s thought. In the laws of nature and science there is only necessity, and it is preposterous to conclude that we are supposed to remain satisfied with these laws. The explosive personalities of Dostoevsky’s characters serve as a helpful poster board to the battle that takes place in every man’s soul—if they allow it. The majority of people accept necessity with resignation, and it is Shestov’s fight to prove through Biblical witness that it is not the correct existential alignment for human beings. 

Berdyaev was another philosopher who attempted to define the self apart from necessity; however, his thought focused more on the role of the individual and his creative freedom. “But personality is not a part of the universe, the universe is a part of personality, it is its quality. Such is the paradox of personalism… Personality is recognized only as a subject, in infinite subjectivity, in which is hidden the secret of existence.”2 Berdyaev hopes to make man the center of the world, because inside of man, he argues, is God’s imprint; and thus the pursual of personality is most necessary in one’s search for God Himself. Berdyaev makes faith concrete in the way he seeks to reconcile eternity with human existence through personality. If the world imposes slavery upon man through the necessary conditions of science and natural philosophy (which are one and the same), the self is the way that one breaks free—through creative activity. Creativity forces man to determine his own course in the world and thus grow closer to a free God. I will use Berdyaev’s philosophy to build upon the core difference between freedom and necessity as outlined in Shestov, however, I think that Berdyaev ultimately focuses too much on personality instead of God, thus making an idol out of the self. Berdyaev’s philosophy will be an afterthought to the central statement of this essay, that a faith grounded in God’s freedom is necessary for personality, and that this resolves itself into an act of courage. 

“The substance of this faith, emphatically denied by both science and philosophy, is the daring and unsupportive but paradoxically true conviction that all things are possible.”3 The underground man’s convictions are not important because he is crazed and wishing to be free—they have value in their ability to inform us of humanity’s inmost desire. "There is no great genius without a tincture of madness."4 Do we want to accept that twice two equals four? Or is this fact forced upon us to appear sane, because it seems obvious from the standpoint of basic human rationality? The underground man’s desire to break through the wall is the same as not accepting twice two equals four. A wall exists objectively, and if one is imprisoned by it, all they can desire is for it’s objective existence to be broken through by their own world of subjective desire—for the wall to cease existing. If a man was imprisoned unfairly and his conscience was clear, would it be unreasonable for him to wish above all reason that his walls would be broken down? One might say that the walls of logic are placed around man fairly, unlike our prisoner. But is this so? Death, disease, and hierarchical domination all appear to be a part of the natural created order; and would it be fair to ask man to accept his fate amongst these woes without going mad? True neuroses exists in places where man convinces himself that he must tolerate the negative for the sake of the positive, rather than obliterating the negative to fully embrace the positive—wherein people are usually called ‘mad.’ 

“And if the task of philosophy had reduced to the mere demonstration of the possibility of a miracle, her business would have been splendidly accomplished long ago.”5 Shestov believes that miracles are available for witness on the daily—the very creation of the world or the birth of a human. But the problem is that miracles are not enough for people, as nobody wants to believe in them. We could live in an even more miraculous world, and people would still *choose* to close their eyes to it. Widespread doubt comes from cowardice. Man wants control more than he wants God, and to admit that God exists and everything is possible for Him requires courage for man to step into the unknown, beyond the precipice of his own will and understanding. Despair is the common sickness of non-selfhood, as Søren Kierkegaard argued in *The Sickness Unto Death.6* And despair runs rampant in a world where we are bound to the ceiling of necessity because we are too cowardly to approach a throne beyond our control. If God moved a very mountain before our eyes, we would find a way to explain it without God—thus securing ourselves into a reality where there is no silver lining of eternity behind the clouds of the very things which make man sick to begin with—death, and therefore necessity. The largest necessity is death; but by ignoring death we can dig ourselves further into the hole of ‘security,’ which is another word for despair. When Christ calls His followers to a faith in God which defies the reality of death—by His resurrection—He calls the individual to rest his identity outside of himself in a God who cannot be controlled. 

What does this faith have to do with selfhood? It is the individual’s personal choice to believe in God. “Man desires to be strong and rich and free, the wretched, insignificant creature of dust, whom the first chance shock crushes like a worm before one's eyes, and if he speaks of ideas it is only because he despairs of success in his proper search. He feels that he is a worm, he fears that he must again return to the dust which he is, and he lies, pretending that his misery is not terrible to him, if only he knew the truth.”7 We are conditioned as ‘creatures of dust’ to submit to twice two equals four—the walls of death and suffering placed all around us. It lies only in a courageous faith to see the wall and believe that it could no longer be. The question is not one of theodicy. People avoid faith by saying that evil exist for everyone else around them, and thus it is their job to suffer as well. This is a quiet and deadly spring of cowardice that comes from the simple desire to avoid the question of God. If God exists for the individual, the walls may fall away, but only if he is willing to believe. This requires the individual to focus all of their strength on God, on the unknown. If one truly faces the unknown, they look back upon their life through a mirror of transcendence, where the question of universal evil falls away, because it is apparent that God Himself is too great a mystery to know why it would exist in the first place. The answer that the man of faith receives is that of Job: “I am who I am.”8 There are no more walls in the great *I am*—they disappear through the lens of God’s omnipotence. “Freedom consists in the force and power not to admit evil into the world.”9Is it insane to deny the existence of evil? Well, most would say it is insane to deny that twice two equals four. The freedom of God requires much, and the reward of eternity is far better than a neat equation. 

While I don’t believe in all of the ends of Berdyaev’s personalist thought, some of it serves as helpful practical implications for what faith means for man. “There is a psychological force of the individual person, and there is a psychological force of the community, of society. Crystallized, hardened public opinion becomes violence upon man. Man can be a slave to public opinion, a slave to custom, to morals, to judgments and opinions which are imposed by society.”10 The majority of society lives by forces of science and ‘knowledge,’ which, qua Shestov, limit their ability to grow in faith and therefore in true knowledge—it is necessary to cut oneself off from the mob in order to grow alongside God. This is a common belief shared throughout the Bible, first where God selects Israel from amongst the other nations, and then when Jesus calls his followers to take the ‘narrow road.’11 

People do not want to break from the boundaries of the norm, because they are afraid. Life itself is full of fear, because of death. And it is easier to face death when you know that others share the same fate, because the scariest part of dying is being alone. Humans were created to rely on each other, and this reliance comes out most poignantly when they are faced with death. It is necessary to not only overcome the fear of death, but to overcome the fear of dying alone. This is impossible. A human will always reach out for something beyond itself to assuage the crushing weight of loneliness. The solution of our philosophy is not to overcome the fear of loneliness, but to replace it with faith that God is always near. One may reach out their hand to the abyss, if they are crushed and perish alone; but they know, through faith, that God reaches down to grab them first. “Fear is overcome by an integrated centralized personality, by an intensive experience of the dignity of personality.”12 This ‘dignity of personality’ comes from the experience of God inside of one’s soul.13 

“We cannot, however, create God: we can only be united to Him, serve Him with our creative activity, answer His call. Knowledge requires great daring. It means victory over ancient, primeval terror.”14 Berdyaev’s ethics rely on the individual seeing their moral life as an extension of their creative activity. Eternity itself, for him, is ‘creative and dynamic,’ because it is echoed through the subjective movements of finite man. We do not know eternity in and of itself, and we will not until the next life—it it is foolish to try and mirror its actions through a reality which is not our own. There are two aspects of man that are in tension: the “primeval, utterly undetermined potential freedom springing from the abyss of non-being, and the element determined by the fact that man is the image and likeness of God, a Divine idea which his freedom may realize or destroy.”15 Man must tap into his inherent divinity within the confines of his finitude. And finitude is not to be underestimated through language—it is the reality of death, despair, and an ever so present terror in the face of utter loneliness. God does not bring one out of these conditions for them of look back down at the rest of humanity with an air of superiority. God rescues a soul only when it is in need of being rescued; and when there is real need, the resulting reality of grace, peace, and eternity that follows can only fester in a cushion of humility and love for other people, because nobody who truly acknowledges their finitude feels like they deserve to be exalted afterward. 

Shestov and Berdyaev share the common approach that faith goes beyond the limits of reason and is necessary for a life of authenticity that exceeds the natural capacities of man. My own deduction from their thought is that courage is necessary in a life of faith, because God is a fearful force outside of one’s understanding of good and evil. Shestov in particular quoted Neitzsche often in his understanding that God exceeds the bounds of human moral understanding—not because he is an evil God, but because we are limited creatures. If one can approach the almighty in authenticity, as an omnipotent and omniscient entity that dwells entirely outside of our understanding, then they have enough spiritual courage to face anything that might oppose them in the physical world—and they will always win, if they have this faith, because God is on their side. 

Shestov’s conception of the self is focused on rebellion against conceptions of being that are enslaving to the individual, and Berdyaev focuses on how the self is a means towards creative fulfillment. Shestov’s faith finds its truth beyond good and evil, whereas Berdyaev has more reliance in the goodness inherent to creation, as Christ was incarnate. Berdyaev says that there is more virtue in someone who would work towards an evil end through means of goodness. I disagree and would side with Shestov’s Nietzschean tendencies, because humans can easily deceive themselves about good and evil. The end towards which they work is more significant, because virtue is only attainable through an almost blind faith in the mystery of a sovereign God.  

Faith is necessary in the development of personality, because truth lies outside of our world order. One cannot find themselves in twice two equals four, because this is one aspect of finitude. Natural philosophy is not useless entirely; but it cannot be applied to find one’s self, because personality is supposed to reflect the image of God within man, and in order to do so one must come into contact with God Himself. God exists outside of the boundaries of the created order. To step out of these boundaries requires courage, because it is unknown and it is a lonely task—as most people choose to spend their entire lives within the confines of finitude. Therefore, faith requires courage; and it is a courage that creates the most beautiful possible reality—a personality that reflects God.

When one sees this God inside of their self, they see themselves as a piece of His artwork, and can therefore understand themselves as having infinite worth.
