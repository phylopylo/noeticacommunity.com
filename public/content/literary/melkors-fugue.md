<center>*The writings of J.R.R. Tolkien as a response to the problem of evil and suffering*


*“The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.”*  *(Haldir of Lórien)[^1]* 

*“…I can’t tell you what I mean.  It ought to be sung.”*  *(Sam Gamgee)[^2]*

***Introduction***

The problem of evil has been a source of contention since the earliest days of theological reasoning: why would a good, omnipotent God create a world riddled with evil? Or to put the point more acutely, why, according to the Christian narrative, did He create a pristine world with the seeds of its destruction contained therein, as shown in the narrative of the fall? The fact of horrendous evil and suffering in a world which the Christian God supposedly pronounced good remains a serious challenge to belief in that selfsame God today, with many thinkers ascribing to evil the status of a necessary foil to highlight the good (Hegel), or suggesting that suffering is in fact the very meaning of existence (Schopenhauer). Both of these approaches loosely concord to a specifically Christian shape of argument that is, the *felix culpa* approach, which is in short, the belief that the fall by which evil and suffering come into the world wins a higher, deeper and richer good than could ever have been attained had not evil first been created. The important point — or indeed mistake — with which one must approach both Hegel’s and Schopenhauer’s philosophies, is that for them reality begins from the fall. In a misinterpretation of *felix culpa,* they both, in different ways, make the fall the necessary condition for existence.

It is the task of this essay to correct these mistakes and give a presentation of *felix culpa,* using the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien as a theological matrix, with some help from Søren Kierkegaard. I hope to accurately reflect the Christian position set forward in the Old and New Testaments that have been illuminated across Christian liturgy —a position for which the fall is always a tragedy and should have been avoided, but which nevertheless is still transfigured by the death and resurrection of Jesus as a *felix culpa,* a happy fall, for which paradoxically life in the world is some degree richer. The difficulty of ordinary language in expressing this is such that the language of myth and legend, perfected by Tolkien across his corpus, not least in *The Lord of the Rings,* provides a helpful platform, even a theological sandbox within which the various philosophies of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Kierkegaard can be tested, and their weaknesses and strengths analyzed therein.  

The phrase *felix culpa,* is adopted from the Roman liturgy used upon the night of the Easter vigil, in which the priest sings these remarkable words, transfiguring the plangent *mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa* of the penitent’s mournful beating of the breast all the year round, into a mighty flame of love erupting out upon the night of the resurrection as a *felix culpa,* a happy fault:

O certe necessárium Adæ peccátum,  
quod Christi morte delétum est\!

O felix culpa,  
quæ talem ac tantum méruit habére Redemptórem\![^3]

The same sentiment, moreover, is expressed in the Middle English hymn, *Adam lay ybounden,* in which Adam is blessed for taking the forbidden fruit, so that the mother of God might have been enthroned in heaven. The general idea then, is this: that the resounding victory won by Christ over sin and death, and even His people’s subsequent triumph within creation far outweighs the gentle bliss of a world never tainted by sin. The theologian, admittedly, must have some gall to play this card.  It is a hair’s breadth away from making God the author of evil, the argument’s potentially fatal flaw.[^4] On paper, it might seem callous, unintuitive, and even blasphemous to more sensitive theological minds. It is here where the strength of Tolkien’s mythic expression comes into its own. 

For in Tolkien’s presentation, evil, despite being permitted by God for a deeper purpose, remains something lamentable and sorrowful, something to be resisted and condemned in every setting, such that the final joy wrought in salvation is itself imbued with a poignant sense of loss. It is the remarkable nature of the claim, that this subtle poignancy, this bittersweet mote flecked within the empyrean of eternal joy, makes it richer and deeper than if evil had never happened. The same sentiment is expressed by C.S. Lewis scholar, Michael Ward, who, in writing on Lewis’ relationship to suffering, comments upon the connection between the resurrection and the cross: “It is essential, though, that this *re*intrepretation of the events of Good Friday does not get entangled with the initial interpretation of them…If knowledge of the resurrection is allowed prematurely to interfere with our understanding of the cross we have not properly understood the cross. We have not, as it were, heard the ‘lived language’, we have not encountered the ‘true myth’ in which events happen consecutively and only consecutively.”[^5]

The crucifixion, then, is always *first* a tragedy. It begins in lament, with the mother of God weeping before the foot of the cross, in the immeasurable depths of inconsolable grief. Moreover, it does not cease to be a tragedy, even after the resurrection. What it becomes, emancipated from the crude polarities of happiness and sadness, cast in the new mind borne in the resurrection, awake to the fiery language of a once hidden world, is barely utterable. Nevertheless, the believer is able to sing, not in mere happiness, but in something far deeper, the words of Fortunatus’ hymn, “The Cross shines forth in mystic glow…O Tree of glory, Tree most fair/ Ordained those holy limbs to bear/ How bright in purple robe it stood/ The purple of a Saviour’s blood.”[^6]  

This then, is where the argument wishes to run, to reach a point of adoration for the crucified God and the glorious beauty of the crucifixion with no diminishment of the tears shed beneath it, to exult and rejoice in the cross, without making light of the lamentation of which it is the culmination. Tolkien’s writings will be an aid in doing this, though they are not essential to the argument. With more words and greater resources, one could easily do the same for Dostoevsky’s *Brothers Karamazov*, Dante’s *Divina Comedia,* or the writings of Martin Luther.  As for the latter, there is certainly a strong correlation between Luther’s view of beauty — which finds beauty at its greatest intensity in the bloody spectacle of God hanging upon the cross[^7] — and the argument for beauty wrought out of evil presented here. To give a gentle nod to the reformer here, the essence of this paper might be summed up in his very words: “daß Gott nur in Leiden und Kreuz zu finden ist.”[^8] Nevertheless, it is Tolkien who is near to this author both in space, time, and language, and is therefore whom this writer has chosen to make a point which, one hopes, transcends the very beautiful world of elves and men, to point to something higher and deeper, not only than Middle-earth, but this realm of our own ephemeral and often fragile existence.

There are cautions to be made here, and potential wrong turns, many of which can be found within Tolkien’s writings and will be considered here, especially the error of aligning with evil having mistaken it for the good (Saruman), or abandoning hope in favour of complete resignation in the face of evil’s strong foothold within the warp and weft of the world (Denethor).  Nevertheless, the radical claim of Tolkien’s corpus, it shall be argued, is that despite these very real dangers, if one commits oneself to fight against evil with every breath until the bitter end (as most of Tolkien’s characters do), to live a life of faith (Kierkegaard) then at last its true purpose becomes apparent, and the life of sorrow can indeed be called blessed.  All this shall be considered. But first: the beginning. 

(i) Creation and Evil within Tolkien’s Corpus

It is without a doubt that the problem of evil is a dominant theme within Tolkien’s writings. In a short story placed at the very beginning of the posthumously published *Silmarillion,* this is made abundantly clear. The tale, entitled the *Ainulindalë,* the song of the Ainur, narrates how the supreme being, Eru, or Ilúvatar, sings the world into being in the presence of his divine council, or entourage, the Ainur, who all sing together in blessed harmony. One of these, named Melkor, is not content to sing the harmony given him, and chooses to sing his own tune instead, loudly and forcefully in an attempt to drown out the music of the others. In response to this, Eru is compelled to rearrange his own music to comprise Melkor’s, as the melodies strafe and strive, one with another, until Eru is forced to conclude the entire musical journey with a single resounding chord, “deeper than the Abyss, higher than the Firmament, piercing as the eye of Illúvatar.” [^9]

Tolkien is clearly not making God to be the direct author of evil. Evil, rather, is the result of the abused freedom of a particular member of Eru’s creation, in the character of Melkor. Nevertheless Eru made Melkor, and even, perhaps more than the other Ainur, relies upon him to sharpen His own melody into something new, and eventually to provide the resistance against which He produces His final, resounding chord. The tension here, between a quasi-dualistic picture of good and evil battling it out in song, and the abused freedom of a finite creature, a tension which persists into *The Lord of the Rings,* is described by Shippey as that between Manichaean and Boethian views of evil.[^10] Indeed, Shippey goes as far as to say that “a good way to understand *The Lord of the Rings* in its full complexity is to see it as an attempt to reconcile two views of evil, both old, both authoritative, both living, each seemingly contradicted by the other.”[^11] Shippey’s two views, the Platonic-Augustinian-Boethian, that of evil as not a thing in itself but as corruption or lack, *privatio boni,* and the Zoroastrian-Manichaean, evil as a substantial force, although they go a great deal of the way in explaining the presentation of evil in Tolkien’s work*,* however fail to appreciate two fundamental insights: firstly, that Tolkien is reaching back to a time of thought before the emergence of the distinctions; secondly, that these distinctions are themselves made to justify the problem of evil in the world.

To elaborate the latter point: characterizing evil as either as *privatio boni* or as a primal force in eternal striving with the good are two rudimentary attempts at theodicy. They explain away evil by either ascribing it a place in the ultimate reality or by banishing it to the realm of illusion. Tolkien is not content with either of these cop-outs. He presents evil in all its diverse manifestations — both as a substantial presence but also as a parasitical corruption of what is good. He resists philosophical determinations of evil, and in so doing makes the task of responding to the problem of evil far more difficult. In other words, Tolkien raises the stakes as high as he possibly can, to produce a more genuine and sincere response.  Evil cannot be defined as an explainable place. The Ring, to quote Shippey, is both “sentient creature” and “psychic amplifier.”[^12] It infects and pervades not merely beings, but also Being;[^13] sin is both understood as definable action and a general posture of hatred and resentment, wherefore the battle to resist it, and to justify the existence of God’s good world in the light of it, must be fought on every front, a contest to which it is now time to turn.

(ii) The Depth of the Claim: *felix culpa* and contemporary thought

In order to appreciate the depth of Tolkien’s presentation of the *felix culpa* approach to the problem of evil, it is important first to compare it with a contemporary presentation of the argument. This will make it possible to discern certain shades of meaning within the *felix culpa* approach, and also to define more clearly what Tolkien’s argument exactly is by placing it beside what it is not. One highly creative reappropriation of *felix culpa* can be found in the writings of the Hegelian philosopher, Slavoj Zizek, in his recent work *Event.[^14]* Zizek’s argument is to seek to define the notion of Fall, that is Adam taking the forbidden fruit, or in our context, Melkor choosing to sing his dissonant melody under the philosophical category of Event. Zizek describes it as “*the loss of some primordial unity and harmony which never existed, which is just a retroactive illusion.”[^15]* There is a subtlety here: Adam could only know that he was living in a pristine world after he had taken the fruit that gave him consciousness of a world marked by transgression. Likewise, the very notion of universal harmony and consonance could only be properly understood at the moment when Melkor began to be dissonant. The fall is a necessary step in the creation of the perfect world which the broken world is set against. Thus *felix culpa.* 

Zizek outlines his indebtedness to Hegel here: “Hegel’s point is that Good emerges as a possibility and duty only through this primordial choice of Evil: we experience Good when, after choosing Evil, we become aware of the utter inadequacy of our situation.”[^16] This is all bound up with a view of the world which considers it to be an unfolding of the human consciousness in a dialectical oscillation between different points of thought. Zizek writes later in his work, that “the dialectical process is thus more refined than it may appear. The standard notion is that, in it, one can only arrive at the final truth through the path of errors, so these errors are not simply discarded, but ‘sublated’ in the final truth, preserved in it as moments. What this standard notion misses is how the errors are ‘sublated’ (negated-preserved-elevated) *precisely as superfluous.*”[^17] This is significant: the wrongs which take place within the world upon its journey to the absolute, though essential for pushing the world upon its journey, are themselves retroactively deemed *superfluous,* as if they never were, “with no more significance than cutting off a head of cabbage or swallowing a mouthful of water.”[^18]

There is a significant difference here between Zizek’s *felix culpa* and that which we are ascribing to Tolkien; for where Zizek and Hegel situate the Good as the creation of an unfolding, rational self-consciousness, or community of self consciousnesses, for Tolkien goodness truly dwells in some metaphysical beyond, a feature of his work which shall be considered later. Where for Hegel and Zizek, Good arises almost as a foil to Evil in the unfolding dialectic, it is not so for Tolkien.  Good was there in the beginning, and it will be there in the end, and it is to Goodness which Evil must be held to account. Moreover, the effects of evil in the world are not sublated in the Hegelian sense, but sublated in a rather different sense, much more akin to the wounds of Christ which are carried down from the cross, into hell, and onto the resurrected body of our Lord, where they remain for eternity.  

“The wounds of the Spirit heal,” writes Hegel, “and leave no scars behind,” but it is not so for Tolkien.[^19] As Gandalf says in the wake of the Battle of Helm’s Deep, “The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been.”[^20] A similar sentiment is expressed when Frodo and Sam come for the first time near the blackened and bruised land surrounding Mordor, “the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing — unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion.”[^21]  Perhaps the idea is conveyed with greatest potency in the final pages of the book in a passage worth quoting at length, in which Frodo, having carried his burden to the end, comes to leave Middle-earth by taking a ship from the Grey Havens, and on the point of leaving confesses to Sam the irreparable trauma with which he has been afflicted:

*“‘Where are you going, Master?’ cried Sam, though at last he understood what was happening.*  
*‘To the Havens, Sam,’ said Frodo.*  
*‘And I can’t come.’*  
*‘No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not further than the Havens. Though you too were a Ring-bearer, if only for a little while.  Your time may come. Do not be too sad, Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years.  You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.’*  
*‘But,’ said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, ‘I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done.’*  
*‘So I thought too, once.  But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam.  I tried to save the Shire and it has been saved, but not for me.  It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.”[^22]*

The difference between the Hegelian *felix culpa* and that of Tolkien could not be made clearer.  The argument is not dependent upon the retrospective erasure of ills that were only ever wrought for the sake of some final good; the argument maintains and acknowledges past ills as ills, the wounds which they had given being often incurable, and yet still insists that the depth and significance of the triumph over such ills is so powerful and so rich, that the state of affairs which led to those wounds being afflicted can sincerely be called blessed. 

The tension here is unbearable, and it is an enigma that often leads even the wise astray. Though it be necessary before the end to consider the nature of such a triumph to justify eternal wounds, before that, it behooves us to consider a feature of Tolkien’s narrative in *The Lord of the Rings* which illustrates the real and present dangers of erring upon this very question, and in confusing evil for good, being led to become an instrument of malign intent. It is time, indeed, to consider Saruman.

**(**iii**)  The Witlessness of the Wise; Saruman’s error and other follies**

“Nothing is evil in the beginning,” speaks Elrond, “even Sauron was not so.”[^23] The journey towards Evil, for Tolkien, is always a decline from the Good, and one of the easiest ways to find oneself at the bottom of that path, it seems, is to err upon this very question of the purpose of evil in the world, and by some perverse twist of reasoning, to begin to declare Evil to be Good, a point particularly prescient in a discussion concerning *felix culpa.* Saruman, within the story, represents a figure of great wisdom, learned in all kinds of lore and knowledge, who by his learning is led astray to join the dark forces of Sauron. Treebeard, the Ent, speaks mournfully concerning how the trees of Isengard (Saruman’s domain) were chopped down to make way for an industrial complex with the sad intent of participating in Sauron’s war against Middle-earth. “He is plotting to become a Power,” says Treebeard, “He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment.”[^24]

This shift within Saruman’s heart, from merely gathering wisdom to aid, nourish and heal a broken and bleeding world (like Gandalf), to scheming as to how he might reconfigure the world to different ends, was doubtless justified to himself. Gandalf records Saruman’s words to him, “The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning.  The time of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world of men, which we must rule.  But we must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see.”[^25]  There is a curious echo to the progress of the Hegelian consciousness, which in attaining *absolute freedom,* finds that “the world is for it simply its own will, and this is a general will.”[^26] Kalkavage explains this section of Hegel thus: “The world is now the possession of the self, or the individual not as passive spectator but as active force, indeed as the creative force that has shaped, and continues to shape, the world of culture. In the instrumentality of the useful, the self sees its own practicality or being-at-work, its world-creating, world-transformative power. It sees the useful as the image of the will.”[^27]

The wizard continues his speech, outlining the benefits of an alliance with Sauron, “As the Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish.”[^28] Hegel writes that in the manifestation of *absolute freedom,* culture brings an end to itself, as the soul turns inward again and leaves the outward world behind; “the culture to which it \[absolute freedom\] attains…is, therefore the grandest and the last, is that of seeing its pure, simple reality immediately vanish and pass away into empty nothingness.”[^29] It is not hard to draw the connection here between the culture of the third age of Middle-earth finding its climax on the point of Sauron’s rapacious claim for total domination.

The beauteous and elegant culture of Middle-earth within which *The Lord of the Rings* is set relies upon the Ring lore — the technology, even the culture — of Sauron. The three Rings given to the elves by Sauron long ago are still existent at the time of *The Lord of the Rings,* held by Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel to uphold the present order, and Frodo’s eradication of the One Ring destroys the power of the elven rings, such that whether Sauron triumphs or suffers defeat, the world portrayed within the covers of the novel is sure to pass away. “Do you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom?” speaks Galadriel to Frodo. “For if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlórien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.”[^30]

The decline of the elves and the rising of a new world order is inevitable, the consequences of a wretched fall set in motion long ago. Saruman on this front is right: the Elder Days are gone. But to attempt to reinvent that fall as a victory, and to use it to justify taking the side of Evil for the sake of sublating present ills to an imagined future, is for Tolkien, madness, a grotesque distortion of the *felix culpa* which the broader novel presents.  

Saruman is not the only figure to fall into this trap, though he is able to justify it most eloquently.  Boromir, of course, very openly desires to take the One Ring and use it as a weapon against the Dark Lord, perhaps not understanding the nature of his desire.  “It is mad,” he says, “not to use it, to use the Power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these alone will achieve victory…The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner.”[^31] Boromir too believes the way of Power, the way of technology, of authority for its own sake, to be the way forward, thus making himself to be an instrument of whatever power lies behind the Dark Lord. Even Frodo errs in this direction, at the very beginning of the book (before being swiftly corrected by Gandalf), when he exclaims concerning Gollum, “What a pity Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance\!”[^32] A sentiment which, if carried through, would likely have meant the very destruction of Middle-earth, in the light of Gollum’s subsequent instrumental role in leading the hobbits to Mordor, and, unintentionally preventing Frodo from keeping the Ring at the last. 

This danger, of confusing good with evil, is the most common and easy misinterpretation of the *felix culpa* line of reasoning, and is an error which Tolkien cautions the reader against time and time again in many of his characters, not least the three shown above. Nevertheless, there is another danger which Tolkien is keen to preserve us from, to prevent any kind of over compensation, so to speak, and that is the danger of pessimism, lest the reader, their mind well sobered against the promise of endless progress or absolute power and disabused of the myth of a naïve universalistic redemption, begins to imagine that there is nothing good in the world left to fight for. This is the primary error of Lord Denethor, Steward of Gondor.

**(**iv**) The Knight of Despair and the Knight of Faith; Denethor and Samwise**

There are some strong similarities between Denethor and Saruman; both are old, wizened men closeted in their towers, gazing into their Palantìrs, seeking to discern the ways of the tides of time and fate. Tolkien invites this comparison through his description of the man, as seated before Gandalf: “Denethor, looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older.”[^33] The reader is invited to behold Denethor, and in some extent, to marvel at him, and to admire him. As Gandalf remarks, “he is not as other men of this time.”[^34]  

Nevertheless, the differences are clear. Denethor will never ally himself with Sauron; he is acutely aware that the designs of the Dark Lord work against Gondor, and exclusively for Sauron’s own gain. He understands Evil to be Evil, and he understands that, as Sauron’s forces amass against the walls of Minas Tirith, that Evil has the upper hand. His mistake however, is in suggesting that an Evil fate can never be transformed into a good one, that the presence of the rot is already the sign of an absolute defeat at its hands, the fundamental knot of hope which lies at the heart of *felix culpa,* concretized by Frodo as he praises the unlikely friendship arisen between himself and Faramir, “To have found it turns evil to great good,”[^35] a sentiment which Denethor seems to be insulated from, having become lost in the labyrinth of reasoning suggested to him by the Palantìr. 

This utter hopelessness is demonstrated by his resolute decision to die rather than fight for the security of his people. “Better to burn sooner,” he speaks, “than late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire\! And I? I will go now to my pyre. To my pyre\!  No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No tomb\! No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the West. The West has failed. Go back and burn\!”[^36]  The fight, it must be granted, is from his perspective, hopeless, for Denethor does not know of the mighty force which Aragorn leads from the Dwimorberg. This, however, for Tolkien, in no way justifies Denethor’s decision, which is presented as a great error of judgment, the reference to heathen kings being perhaps the only explicit reference in the work to the fact that Middle-earth stands upon the other side of some kind of implicitly Christian revelation, a light which Denethor seems to be actively neglecting in his decision making. Denethor chooses death, burning of his own volition, with the terrible claim of “I will have *naught*: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.”[^37]

The tension of the *felix culpa* is such that, despite having avoided the possibility of aligning one’s interests with Evil itself, Denethor, confronted by the immortal wounds of the world and failing to reconcile them with the good creation wrought by Illúvatar, finds himself abandoning the life of faith altogether, falling back upon a metaphysics which belonged to men before the time of Numenor, a metaphysics of total darkness and unending strife. Denethor’s exclamation, ‘The West has failed,’ is more than a lament for lack of martial resources or capacity. Rather, in the expectation of Sauron covering the land in a second darkness, and the cold hard fact of ills having been wrought which are in themselves incurable (such as the death of his son, Boromir), Denethor is announcing the catastrophic failure of an entire web of beliefs and customs brought to Middle-earth from Numenor, and proclaiming the Numenorean impulses of creativity, openness, optimism, charity and hope — impulses which have been crudely distorted and perverted in the hands of both Sauron and Saruman — to be void and empty.

Denethor is not alone in this conclusion. In our world, the philosopher Schopenhauer, having seen the Hegelian distortion of creativity, optimism, and progress, famously concluded that these very impulses themselves were falsehoods. For his philosophical edifice, Schopenhauer, having largely rejected Christianity, drew extensively from Hindu traditions to craft a secular expression of an ontology of nothingness, that “this very real world of ours with all its sun and galaxies, is—nothing.”[^38] His own summary of the failure of the West, or of Christianity, is couched in the terms of Hindu philosophy: “We,” he writes, “now send to the Brahmans English clergymen and evangelical linen-weavers, in order out of sympathy to put them right, and to point out to them that they are created out of nothing, and that they ought to be grateful and pleased about it. But it is just the same as if we fired a bullet at a cliff. In India our religions will never at any time take root; the ancient wisdom of the human race will not be supplanted by the events in Galilee.”[^39]

Whether Schopenhauer’s reading of the Upanishadic tradition which he so venerates is accurate is beyond the scope of this essay.[^40] Crucially, for this discussion, Schopenhauer argued that the very meaning of life is suffering. “If the immediate and direct purpose of our life is not suffering,” writes Schopenhauer, “then our existence is the most ill-adapted to its purpose in the world: for it is absurd to suppose that the endless affliction of which the world is everywhere full, and which arises out of the need and distress pertaining essentially to life, should be purposeless and accidental. Each individual misfortune, to be sure, seems an exceptional occurrence; but misfortune in general is the rule.”[^41] This, in its own way, is a crude twisting of the *felix culpa,* for it posits the fall, or fallenness as a necessary condition of existence. He indeed writes, “Nothing is more certain than that, generally speaking, it is the grievous *sin of the world* which gives rise to the manifold and great *suffering of the world*; whereby is meant not any physical-empirical connexion but a metaphysical one. The story of the Fall is consequently the only thing which reconciles me to the Old Testament.”[^42] This philosophy, therefore, is in love with the Fall, in a way totally contrary to the shape of argument put forward by Tolkien. 

Schopenhauer’s pessimism represents a minority voice in the philosophical symposium, as Denethor within Middle-earth seems to stand alone.[^43] There is both a simplicity and an elegance to solving the problem of evil by proclaiming suffering, death and nothingness to be the ultimate reality, a solution which promises some kind of relief from the ceaseless longing that characterizes human life. “Then,” writes Schopenhauer, “instead of the restless pressure and effort; instead of the constant transition from desire to apprehension and from joy to sorrow; instead of the never-satisfied and never-dying hope that constitutes the life dream of the man who wills, we see that peace that is higher than all reason, that ocean-like calmness of the spirit, that deep tranquillity, that unshakeable confidence and serenity, whose mere reflection in the countenance, as depicted by Raphael and Correggio, is a complete and certain gospel.”[^44]

This romance of nothingness, this headlong rush into the void, cannot escape the inexorable pain of the presence of evil in the world. Choosing death over life is not a solution to the problem, but to needlessly multiply griefs, sorrows and confusion for those left behind. One is never above the problem of evil. The pessimistic ontology of nothingness which results in self-destruction does not evade it but heightens it all the more. Tolkien presses this upon us, viscerally, in the horrendous image of Denethor as the father who would seek to slay his own son to satisfy his own commitment to the void.

In truth, there is no adequate treatment of the problem of evil which does not face the question of suicide. To live in a world where the conditions have been created such by God that some of his creatures could turn into themselves and consider the void rather than the creation, is a kind of nightmare, even if one has never felt such a drive oneself to know that it is out there, and not to know, if that drive were to break suddenly upon one in some cold sweat of the night, whether one would have the strength to resist it. Yet that is the world which God has made, and it is a world where many face that contest, and lose, with no guardian angel given to hold them back from the abyss.  It seems as if, in the crucial moment, God’s love and grace is for many proven to be empty, hollow, and a lie. Denethor is abandoned to his emptiness, hands clasped pathetically upon his Palantìr, the beginning of his misfortunes, and the end of his sanity, leaving behind a son, broken upon the sight of his father in tight thrall to the worship of monstrous death. 

Tolkien, however, provides some small answer to this, for Denethor is not the first character to consider suicide. Indeed, kneeling upon the top of the stairs of Cirith Ungol, thinking Frodo to be dead, Samwise Gamgee, if only for a moment, considers the void: “He looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve. That was not what he had set out to do.”[^45] Sam Gamgee chooses to face the fires of Mordor over and against the void, and finds only in the possibility of fighting against evil, of taking the Ring to Mount Doom, the strength to struggle on. There is always for Tolkien, the choice to fight on, to suffer well, to carry one’s cross all the way to the end, even if that end is a miserable and gruesome death.  Better, however, a slim hope of marvelous triumph, than to resign oneself to absolute defeat. For there is always the choice, to adopt the language of Søren Kierkegaard, to take the leap, to skip over the gaping chasm of despair, to ride thundering across the scarred and battle worn plain, not as a mere man doomed to die, but as a knight of faith, one’s armour and sword gleaming in the light of the rising sun, the fanfare of the horns pealing across the mountains.[^46]

Sam Gamgee, then, is the Kierkegaardian knight of faith. “He is solid through and through. His stance? Vigorous, it belongs altogether to finitude, no smartly turned-out townsman taking a stroll out to Fresburg \[or Bywater\] on a Sunday afternoon treads the ground with surer foot; he belongs altogether to the world, no *petit bourgeois* belongs to it more…This man takes pleasure, takes part, in everything…No heavenly glance or any other sign of the incommensurable betrays him; if one didn’t know him it would be impossible to set him apart from the rest of the crowd; for at most his hearty, lusty psalm-singing proves that he has a good set of lungs. In the afternoon he takes a walk in the woods. He delights in everything he sees, in the thronging humanity, the new omnibuses,”[^47] and so on.  

This is also, furthermore, the man Chesterton describes, originally speaking of St Francis, who passes so far into the depths of the earth in darkest despair that he eventually finds himself passing through to the other side, with his love for the world profoundly changed, “altered even in being increased.  He might see and love every tile on the steep roofs or every bird on the battlements; but he would see them all in a new and divine light of eternal danger and dependence.”[^48] Tolkien’s own early poem, *Mythopoeia,* expresses this posture or manner of attending to the world in similarly elegant terms, in context referring to the original myth makers who used their stories to make sense and to overcome the challenges and paradoxes of the worlds they encountered:

*They have seen Death and ultimate defeat,*   
*and yet they would not in despair retreat,*  
*but oft to victory have turned the lyre*   
*and kindled hearts with legendary fire,*   
*illuminating Now and dark Hath-been*   
*with light of suns as yet by no man seen.[^49]*

Where there is a knight of faith, the option and the possibility of despair and ultimate nothingness melt away, revealing a broad, and bright expanse within which there is great room to breathe. And there is not only one in *The Lord of the Rings.* Strider is the knight of faith. Gimli is the knight of faith. Legolas is the knight of faith. Even Frodo is the knight of faith. All who reject despair, who fight on in hope that the Good of Illúvatar shall prevail, and who manage, in so doing, “to express the sublime in the pedestrian,”[^50] like so many in Tolkien’s work, these are all the knight of faith.  This then, is the triumph which makes an earth rent by immortal wounds far preferable than one without, that turns the world from emptiness into song. “The world is indeed full of peril,” speaks Haldir of Lórien, “and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.”[^51]  So it is that in dancing against the darkness, the knight of faith bears witness to a deeper and truer love than if he had never made the leap of faith.

**(**v**) The End of the Music; Looking Towards Arda Remade**

The manner of discourse, the very nature of speech employed, has herein changed. Kierkegaard’s radical challenge to both Hegelian hubris and Schopenhauerian pessimism demonstrates that the problem of evil, and the manner of philosophy with which it is confronted, begins not in an abstract bird’s eye view of the world, in false panoramas like those which both Saruman and Denethor tried to see through their Palantìrs, but in the heart, in the human, elf, dwarf, ent or hobbit self as a creature, circumscribed and bounded in particular ways, with clear limits and definable goals and responsibilities, called to live a certain way within the world, not only to fulfill but also to exceed those capacities given, in pursuit of the Good for which all were made. *Felix culpa* only makes sense while one is engaged in the struggle, while one sheds tears for the Good on behalf of which one is fighting, while one waits with bated breath in the dark captivated by the gentle glow of the Paschal Fire after the trauma of Good Friday, eagerly longing for the joy of anastasis. It is a theodicy of the heart. 

The *felix culpa* approach to the problem of evil, properly understood, does not rely upon one particular event that the individual can point to in order to make sense of the Fall. It is a complete overhaul in posture, in bearing, and in approach.  It is characterized by faith, or indeed hope. It is the resurrection mindset, trusting that there is no reality so far descended into the darkness, that it cannot be raised up into endless light, wounds and all. For in facing evil with such a resolution as to bring forth some concrete good out of the maelstrom of chaos, the movement of faith, so wonderful and dynamic, justifies the awful conditions permitted by God which made such a movement possible. It is not the Good wrought by the knight of faith *after* the movement which justifies this evil world, as if Good and Evil could be balanced on a scale. It is the power of the movement of faith which gives witness to a deeper and higher love behind this broken world far more clearly than if the world hadn’t descended into anguish. Justification is indeed through faith\! There is no moment of anguish, no searing pain of sorrow, no horrendous evil which the knight of faith cannot leap over, transfiguring even the darkest night into a blazing noon. This is the mighty triumph at which the believer might sing in the deepest recesses of the night, *o felix culpa\!* 

What then, is the content of such a faith? Πιστις, according to the writer of the letter to Hebrews, is “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1). In Tolkien’s later writing, the *Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth,* Finrod, defines *estel,* the Quenya equivalent of πιστις, (or fides), as something “not defeated by the ways of the world, for it does not come from experience, but from our nature and first being. If we are indeed the *Eruhin,* the Children of the One, then He will not suffer Himself to be deprived of his own, not by any Enemy, not even by ourselves. This is the last foundation of *Estel,* which we keep even when we contemplate the End: of all His designs the issue must be for His children’s joy.”[^52] The context for this comment is a dialogue between an elf, Finrod, and an human, Andreth, concerning the nature of death, which differs somewhat between the two races. Finrod challenges Andreth’s pessimism regarding the end of humankind, an end which she perceives that all men shall finally pass away, “to go out into darkness unhealed.”[^53] 

This is a prescient comment, especially when considering *The Lord of the Rings.* Yes, Sauron is defeated by the end of *The Lord of the Rings.* Yes, Middle-earth is saved.  Even the Shire is delivered from the wiles of Saruman. It is all, however, for a time. In the end, Aragorn, mortal man that he is, will die.  The old world in all its beauty, Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf with it, has passed away. Even Treebeard, the oldest living thing in Middle-earth, will one day pass away, and with him shall go the last memories of the time before the first darkness in the first age. The destruction of the One Ring and the victory before the *Morannon* are merely the meager fruits of small resistance against an otherwise all-consuming decline. With Galadriel, all must in the end say, that “through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.”[^54] Death comes to all in the end. What then is the basis for the movement of faith? It is the hope of a world made new. Finrod puts it thus to Andreth: “This then, I propound, was the errand of Men, not the followers, but the heirs and fulfillers of all: to heal the Marring of Arda, already foreshadowed before their devising; and to do more, as agents of the magnificence of Eru: to enlarge the Music and surpass the Vision of the World\!  For that Arda Healed shall not be Arda Unmarred, but a third thing and a greater, and yet the same.”[^55]

Therefore, no matter what Evils confront the individual, there is always room for *estel,* for faith, for hope. The promise of the world renewed guarantees the present faith, and makes the movement of faith possible. This is outlined clearly in a single comment of Peregrin Took, seated upon the high wall of Minas Tirith, gazing at the ominous shadow protruding from Mordor, suffering under the sickening cry of the Nazgûl, against which he says, “No, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned, and is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.”[^56] Gandalf is risen\!  Therefore, there is hope.  Resurrection lowers the veil between ourselves and a hidden world, “the inner world, or supersensible beyond”[^57] which Hegel is so keen to disabuse us of. This inner world is threatened by death, the spectre of a self passing into the void never to return — thus it is that the veil is rent at Jesus’ crucifixion, not because suddenly humankind had been brought closer to God, but because the veil which made communion with God possible had itself been broken. However, that selfsame inner world which death rudely challenges is even more so guaranteed by resurrection, which in spewing somebody back from the dead proves definitively that there is a supersensible beyond from which to return. Gandalf’s return lowers the veil, it proves that Middle-earth is not all there is, and that there is a vast, intangible, incomprehensible beyondness waiting to break in upon the cracked and blistering earth, such that all things might be made new. 

Heaven, the realm of the divine, is concerned with all the various happenings which take place upon Earth. Tolkien’s description of the Riders of Rohan’s pyre following their raid against the uruks cements this idea, for “the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven, and was seen by many watchful eyes.”[^58] Gandalf was sent back to continue his work, even as Christ was sent back to vindicate his life, teachings and death, imbuing the cosmos with a new, indefatigable hope, sowing the seeds for many centuries of knights of faith riding across the plains.  “The New Testament image of the future hope of the whole cosmos, grounded in the resurrection of Jesus,” writes Tom Wright, “gives as coherent a picture as we need or could have of the future that is promised to the whole world, a future in which, under the sovereign and wise rule of the creator God, decay and death will be done away, and a new creation born to which the present one will stand as mother to child.”[^59]  

Resurrection not only guarantees the promise of a world beyond the veil; it promises a time when the changeless, timeless, and pure world of the beyond shall be met with the polluted, fragile, and fractured world to wash it clean and make it whole, such that the beauties of both createdness and uncreatedness shall be blent together in an harmonious union, a union which began when God came to earth in the man Jesus of Nazareth. Tolkien’s vision leaves room for this decidedly theological insight, as Andreth remarks to Finrod, “they say that the One will himself enter into Arda, and heal Men and all the Marring from the beginning to the end.”[^60] This shall be the final defeat of Melkor, the end of all evil and suffering, save only in its recollection in the new state, a world which lies beyond the original music sung by Eru and his divine council, and beyond all the entanglements and accoutrements of fate. 

“I have conversed with the Valar who were present at the making of the Music ere the being of the World began,” speaks Finrod, “And now I wonder: Did they hear the end of the Music? Was there not something in or beyond the final chords of Eru which, being overwhelmed thereby, they did not perceive?”[^61]  There are worlds, it seems, that elude the grasp of fate or doom, which cannot be predicted or reasoned into existence, and which defy the limits we set for them. To trust in the advent of such a world, to make the movement of faith and live for this unutterable beyond, is the Christian calling, the *felix culpa* mindset which trusts in the ultimate Good end of all disasters, no matter how dreadful they might appear. It is the vision of that beyond, wholly ineffable, truly unspeakable, which makes a beautiful life here possible. “And then suddenly I beheld as a vision Arda Remade; and there the Eldar completed but not ended could abide in the present for ever, and there walk, maybe, with the Children of Men, their deliverers, and sing to them such songs as, even in the Bliss beyond bliss, should make the green valleys ring and the everlasting mountain-tops to throb like harps.”[^62] It does no harm to quote *Mythopoeia* again, and at length:

*In Paradise perchance the eye may stray*   
*from gazing upon everlasting Day*  
*to see the day-illumined, and renew*  
*from mirrored truth the likeness of the True.*   
*Then looking on the Blessed Land 'twill see*   
*that all is as it is, and yet made free:*   
*Salvation changes not, nor yet destroys,*   
*garden nor gardener, children nor their toys.*   
*Evil it will not see, for evil lies*  
*not in God's picture but in crooked eyes,*   
*not in the source but in malicious choice,*   
*and not in sound but in the tuneless voice.*   
*In Paradise they look no more awry;*  
*and though they make anew, they make no lie.*   
*Be sure they still will make, not being dead,*   
*and poets shall have flames upon their head,*   
*and harps whereon their faultless fingers fall:*   
*there each shall choose for ever from the All.[^63]*

*Conclusion; Into the Sacred Heart of Jesus*

If after reading this paper, one were to take a journey, and wander around the killing fields of Auschwitz-Birkenau, to witness the land polluted, defiled, scarred, even wounded by a sorrow so deep that there are no words, perhaps they would consider this exercise in theodicy, in *felix culpa,* to be trite, juvenile and a denial of all that has happened in the world. If one could reconnect with the nausea felt by the hardened Soviet soldiers as they first discovered what exactly *had* happened in the earth upon which they stood, they might indeed be completely immunized from any possibility of believing in an ultimate good. Only a perverse, twisted kind of soul would wander round those broken crematoriums and mass graves chanting *o felix culpa* under their breath.   It has not, however, been the point of this text to enable triteness, and puerility, and to give licence to those who would seek to deny the world-ending horrors with which humanity has been faced. My hope was to engender, to call to mind, to compel the reader to recollect emotions which do not lie within the fixed boundaries of joy and sorrow, to cultivate new emotions for a new creation, new ears for new music, to feel emotions which, though out of place in this time, shall, when Christ returns to make all things new, find their proper place and their proper names — emotions which begin and end in the sacred heart of Jesus Christ. 

The Christian calling is to embody these new creation emotions in the present, to inaugurate God’s remade world today, to respond to unimaginable suffering with the divine emotions which Christ shows first, even “to be a sign and foretaste of what God wants to do for the entire cosmos.”[^64]  Tolkien’s work provides a place to explore, and to discover these very emotions—to enrich our inner lives with the fresh air that blows in from Arda Remade, and to lift our eyes back to that earth shattering and earth renewing event when Eru did indeed step into the world which he had made, an event which only struck with its full revelatory force in light of the conditions wrought by the Fall. 

How shall Eru heal Middle-earth by stepping into it? What exactly did God do in Jesus of Nazareth such that this broken earth can become that new creation which gives birth to hope in the present?  In a word: he was wounded. Jesus of Nazareth suffered and died at the hands of men, and in so doing, redeemed the world.  The Latin word for wound is *vulnus.* The Greek, τραυμα. From these, come the English words vulnerable and traumatic. God became vulnerable. God was traumatized.  Vulnerability, trauma, and woundedness, through the cross of Christ, find their way into the divine life, and in so doing, redeem the world. Moreover, these are not temporary additions to Jesus’ inner life. As the apostle Thomas discovered, his wounds are eternal, and they define the resurrection life. There is no resurrection life without the wounds, trauma, and scars of past vulnerability. As Jesus is the model for the new creation, it must also be said therefore that there is no new creation without its wounds, without its trauma, and without its scars of past vulnerabilities. There will be tears in the new heavens and the new earth, the poignant recollection of past griefs shall not be past, and tears for those very griefs shall flow unreservedly, only that Christ shall be there to weep with us, and even to wipe each tear from every eye. 

This is the fundamental lesson to be drawn from Tolkien’s response to Evil given across his writings.  There is no shortcut to this end. One might pretend, foolishly, that since wounds are here to stay they must therefore be good, or one might delude oneself into thinking, wrongly, that since the reality given is so deeply bound up with pain it would be better if nothing were to exist at all.  Both mistakes have been detailed at length. It is the life however, lived through its wounds, in hope of a final redemption, which alone can make sense of Evil as Evil, and Good as Good. And, in truth, there is a final redemption, a deep, warm, bright, serene renewal awaiting all the world and its sufferers, which every movement of faith hastens the world towards, one elegant leap at a time, a renewal that does not obliterate nor erase past griefs, but weaves them, softly and subtly into the larger song of the world, to make the harmony ever richer. The point of the matter is this: that the movements of faith are what pull the world ever closer to its end, clearing spaces for God’s love to put deep roots into the earth, enabling Him to draw it back to Himself. The only response to Evil, therefore, is the radical faith that God will turn it into good, and that the very faith rooted in the believer is God’s first step in doing so.  

The wounds of Christ are not a stain upon an otherwise perfect anatomical specimen. On the contrary, they are the marks of victory, trophies, the crown set upon a lifetime of humble obedience and renunciation to the Father’s will. This is demonstrated very pointedly in the later Christian tradition with the image of the stigmata — believers so close to the heart of Christ that they are granted to share his very wounds on their bodies. These wounds are not a curse; they are a blessing. They are not accompanied by the stink of festering putridity. In the case of Padre Pio, a notable recipient of this very gift, it was not the stench of death he reputedly left behind in any given place, but the scent of roses. 

For redemption is neither a loud nor a flamboyant affair, accompanied by earthquakes and trumpet blasts, terrible fires and howling winds, no. It is the scent of roses emanating gracefully from the imprinted wounds of the stigmata; it is the still small voice, barely discernible, spoken behind the slender veil, as even the light of a beloved’s eye is refracted by her tears, heard like the gentle sound of running water, tinkling softly in the deeps of time; it is the quiet light enmeshed in love, caught between longing and laughter, inviting, drawing, promising, hope, truth, peace, and above all, joy everlasting—

**Appendix: *Felix Culpa* transposed into an elven key**

There are many reasons for the depth and richness given in Tolkien’s writings. One important factor is Tolkien’s ingenuity with language invention, and the creation of new words which undergird new worlds within which familiar ideas can be seen anew. In that spirit, here is presented an example of Elven poetry, written in the High Elven tongue, such as might have been sung in the courts of Minas Tirith in the wake of the war of the Ring, which seeks to convey the shape of *felix culpa* in a distinctly elven key:

*Ai úcarë Melko entya*  
*Ya i perian tulnes cormá arcimbelenna\!*

*Ai ránë valima*  
*Ya Elessar turnes epë andondisse fatanyo*  
*andúrilyë alcë ambaronello,*  
*I perianyë hantë cormá mina nenden uro,*  
*entë hyatsen naro morinóressë,*  
*Itan i sornë calentenë andunenna.*

*Aia i arquen estelo turala or nairé\!*  
*Aia i roquen alassëo tulana apairé andunenva\!*  
*Aia i mahtar melmëo itara anarvë\!*  
*Aia Elessar\! Aia Laicolassë\!*  
*Aia Gimli\! Aia Mithrandir\!*  
*Aia i perianni\! Aia illi yurala andunenna,*  
*Alassëva alassena, estelva estelenna,*  
*Elenillor pela tsetenna-*

O necessary sin of Melkor,  
That the halfling brought the Ring to Imladris\!

O happy fault  
That Aragorn triumphed before the gates of hell  
And Andúril shone in the sunrise,  
And the halfling cast the ring into the lake of fire  
Even the gash of flame in the black land  
That the eagles bore them into the West.

Hail the knight of faith, triumphing over sorrow\!  
Hail the rider of joy bearing victory from the West\!  
Hail the warrior of love, gleaming like the sun\!  
Hail Aragorn\! Hail Legolas\!  
Hail Gimli\!  Hail Gandalf\!  
Hail the halflings\! Hail all who are running into the West,  
From joy to joy, from faith to faith,  
Flying beyond the stars-
