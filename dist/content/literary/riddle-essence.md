Essence (n)
1

<center>
extraneous flesh of some Body cut away by shiny, silver
forceps and scissors
wielded by surgeons in crisp, white
masks and gowns
until they reach the Heart, lifeblood of their operation
</center>

2

<center>
filthy men dig through the Dirt looking for 
Gold
when they find it, they hug it to their filthy chests
</center>

3

<center>
oratorâ€™s tongue drips its silver paint
words pour like Vomit
but even he has something to say underneath.
</center>

4

<center>
how much can be Stripped away before it ceases to be
only the Essential can remain
