‘“Who?” is *the* religious question. It is a question about the other man and his claim, about the other being, the other authority. It is a question about love for one’s neighbour.’ 

I want to orient my entire argument around this quote from Dietrich Bonhoeffer because it captures exactly the fundamental theme; it captures what is at stake with the question of God’s existence. 

Let’s begin by clarifying what is implied in the question ‘Who?’ ‘“Who?” is *the* religious question’. (He refers to ‘Who are you?’, the question addressed to Jesus.’) That is as opposed to ‘What?’; ‘What is there?’ ‘What do the scriptures mean?’ It is opposed also to the question ‘How?’ ‘How was the universe created?’ and so on. These are fascinating questions, but as *you* ask yourselves, ‘does God exist?’, you must admit that deep down, this is not what is of gravest concern. The decision for or against God is an existential decision *before* it is worked out in theories of ‘How?’ or ‘What?’. 

The question ‘Who?’ points to an order of knowledge that is prior to the epistemic or theoretical curiosities implied in the other modes of questioning. I mean an order of knowledge that is ethical and interpersonal. 

If we take as an example an interpersonal encounter, you may enjoy the theoretical game of questioning whether the other person really exists; that is the old skeptical problem (which, of course, has no theoretical solution). But in the end, you must *acknowledge* the fullness of the other person and the claim that they have on you. This *acknowledgement* of the other person is a way of knowing that they exist.[^1] Even if, epistemically, I cannot see into the other mind and prove it exists, I am bound to acknowledge them. Because if I do not, I undermine my being in the world and ultimately my own identity. Behind theoretical curiosities are ethical modes of questioning which are more fundamental for our existence. 

Shakespeare’s *Othello* is perfect here because the whole tragedy turns on Othello confusing these two modes of questioning: ethical and epistemic.[^2] Othello gets deceived into thinking Desdemona is cheating on him. All Desdemona can do is beg to be trusted when she says, ‘I love you,’ beg that her claim, her word be acknowledged. But because Othello confuses this sort of relation with an epistemic one, he tragically responds with the hysterical, impossible demand: ‘You love me? Prove it. Give me the evidence.’ 

My claim is that the history of these debates has more or less committed precisely this error. ‘God exists? Prove it.’ Crucially, when Othello makes his demand, he undermines exactly what is meant to be proven; he destroys the loving relation which is grounded on faithfulness and trust. In just the same way, atheists and theists alike risk deploying modes of questioning that obscure what is being questioned. ‘How do I know God exists?’ is just as valid a question as ‘How do I know that you love me?’ 

These questions are meaningful and good as expressions of profound insecurity and loneliness. The persistent temptation to ask these questions betrays our separation from God. The question protests His silence. (‘Why have you forsaken me?’) Or ‘How do I know you love me?’ expresses the opacity of the other person which makes us anxious; an unavoidable feature of our social lives. 

So in this limited sense, ‘How do I know God exists?’ is a valid question. But if the question comes instead from the standpoint of theoretical curiosity, that is, if it genuinely expects a satisfying answer or a list of reasons, it is invalid. It obscures what is being questioned after. 

‘Does God exist?’ ‘How can I know?’ This may be a way of asking ‘Do I have a future? Do we have a future? Or is this it?’ 

We should note that the secular world continues to grapple with exactly this theological anxiety; ‘Do we have a future?’ is an extremely pressing political question right now. Will something new happen, or will right wing populism dominate? We are locked in a history without any events; everything changes but nothing happens. Do we have a future? Or is this it? This question bears on us every time an ecological crisis manifests itself. 

What this shows is that theological ways of thinking and asking *persist* even or especially where theology is disavowed. There are countless other examples; my old professor, Christoph Schwöbel, was always eager to remind his students that our speech about the *market* is distinctly theological; we say ‘it is volatile’ or ‘it is upset’; this mystifies the market’s dependence on human decisions and poses it as something with a *will* of its own. 

In a word, what I have been trying to communicate this whole time is that *theology* is an *intractable problem*. This is shown whenever you are compelled to *acknowledge* the other person; here you are *dependent* on them, just like Othello depends on the word given to him. His refusal of this word was in the end his self-destruction. Dependence, the notion that as humans we have our center always *outside ourselves,* is what theology is all about. 

Nonetheless, humans make attempts at self-possession or self-groundedness; they refuse their dependence on the other person and the vulnerability which this implies. This history of modern capitalism is the history of man’s striving for self possession, striving to locate the ground of his existence *in himself*.[^3] But what this history shows is that such striving always ends in some perverse theological relation; we depend on the market, in gives us our desires. In advertisements, we read what ‘the Other’ wants from us. Consumer society is a system of *orienting knowledge;* it is a means of securing our place in the world. Again, do we have a future? Or is this it? 

Now I will attempt a summary of my entire argument. When we say ‘God exists,’ we grapple with having our center outside ourselves. The proposition is not a theory about the universe that cancels our anxiety by securing for us a stable place in the cosmos. The proposition ‘God exists’ is a way of reconciling ourselves to a fundamental insecurity; we are always in the place of Othello. We must either depend on a word given to us, even in the absence of any external guarantee, or else we refuse this word and destroy ourselves.

The fetish object, the commodity, obscures our own lack and erects the ‘phantasy’ of wholeness, completion, possession.
