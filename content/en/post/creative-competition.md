# Creative Competition

Express your unique creativity in Noetica's competition – where your imagination knows no bounds! This year's theme is Rebirth and Decay, and we are accepting visual works, written pieces, and musical compositions that tackle the theme in any way you see fit. We are looking for paintings, sculptures, photographs, poems, short stories, and music from any genre; if you can think it up, we want to see it! With a top prize of $100 and publication for each of the three categories as well as publication for runners-up, there is much to gain and nothing to lose, so please consider sending us your work.

Send your piece to [noeticawm@gmail.com](mailto:noeticawm@gmail.com) alongside a short biography of yourself. Please include your class year, your major(s) and minor(s), and some background for or discussion of your piece.

# Film Competition

This year Noetica's Creative Competition is also expanding into the realm of film. The theme is Rebirth and Decay and we are looking for well structured and thoughtful films that tackle the theme in any way you see fit. The upper limit for film length is 30 minutes. We are offering a top prize of $500 and publication on our website as well as publication for runners-up.

Send your film to [noeticawm@gmail.com](mailto:noeticawm@gmail.com) alongside a short biography of yourself or your team. Please include your class year(s), your major(s) and minor(s), and some background for or discussion of your piece.
