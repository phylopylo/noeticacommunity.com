A single bird cries out in the rain.
Not a songbird’s cheery tunes,
But a piercing wail set against
The background of light raindrops
And the constant trickle of water
Running through the gutter.
<br><br>
The same tone echoes several times
Until silence again.
Nothing but the light raindrops
And perpetual trickle of runoff
From the gutters.
<br><br>
My soul cries out in harmony
With the wail of a bird
I cannot even see
<br><br>
Then silence as I wait for
God’s answer.
