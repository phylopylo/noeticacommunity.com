# Noetica's Open Submissions Process

Noetica invites submissions on a rolling basis for consideration in our third volume next Spring. **We welcome capstone papers, honors theses, or any long-form, original research papers at any time.** Noetica encourages undergraduates and recent graduates from universities throughout the United States and around the globe to contribute to our growing journal and intellectual forum.

Please submit your work to our **submissions email**, including a short abstract of your paper. Full-length submissions should preferably be sent as an attached Word Document or PDF. During periods outside of the publishing season, our [Submissions Editor](mailto:cmgiles01@wm.edu) will promptly confirm receipt of your submission. We look forward to reviewing your work! [Submissions Email](mailto:noeticawm@gmail.com)

# Submissions for Volume 2 Currently Under Review
The Board of Editors is currently reviewing submissions for the upcoming volume of Noetica. We thank all those who submitted both academic and creative work and look forward to announcing our selections at the end of March.
