      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beginning&#34;&gt;Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noetica is a peer-reviewed undergraduate journal featuring original scholarship in the humanities and beyond as well as creative works relating to the global premodern period. We focus on comparative scholarship that brings the changes and continuities of the premodern past, especially the global Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, to the forefront of contemporary academic discourse. The journal seeks to challenge this modern discourse’s division of knowledge into increasingly limiting and separate disciplines. By promoting interdisciplinarity, Noetica pursues the synthesis of the disparate fields of knowledge into one higher truth, the “noetic.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
